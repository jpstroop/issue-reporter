These values show up when a user validates a file if there is an error; but they don't display in a pop-up window for users to select at the time of encoding as attribute values do via the EAD schema, for instance, unitdate @ type \"inclusive\" and \"bulk.\" Does that make sense?\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/pulibrary/pulfa/issues/333?email_source=notifications&email_token=ABNKKUYLCXTWOJIUG6AAET3QMJESFA5CNFSM4I37BGP2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOD76XR5Q#issuecomment-536705270>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABNKKU4ZX7YYUZ5JFZXYK3DQMJESFANCNFSM4I37BGPQ>.\r\n"
