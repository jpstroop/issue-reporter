This is an application that was being run by OIT for many years, and my group in the library has been asked to take it over. I tried to identify the list of attributes required from the code, and it sounds like I got the wrong list.\r\n\r\nLet's try this one:\r\n\r\nThese are the entries in /etc/shibboleth/attribute-map.xml on the legacy system:\r\n```\r\n<Attribute name=\"urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.3\" id=\"shib_mail\"/>\r\n<Attribute name=\"urn:oid:0.9.2342.19200300.100.1.1\" id=\"shib_netid\" />\r\n<Attribute name=\"urn:oid:2.5.4.4\" id=\"shib_sn\"/>\r\n<Attribute name=\"urn:oid:2.5.4.42\" id=\"shib_givenname\"/>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese attributes are used for Princeton students who need to submit a thesis to fulfill their graduation requirement, and for faculty and staff who need to oversee that process. Apparently Mark Ratliff and Keith Martin have previously been points of contact on this application within OIT, in case that is helpful. I need to set this up twice (for staging and production). Instead of duplicating this information in both tickets, I'm going to keep the conversation here, and once we figure out what is needed for staging we can do that for production too. Does that sound okay?\r\n\r\nAlso, if it would be easier to talk this over on zoom please let me know.\r\n\r\nThank you!\r\nBess Sadler\r\nResearch Data Support Services\r\nPrinceton University Library"
