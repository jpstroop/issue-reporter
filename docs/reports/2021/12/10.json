A rolling deployment would have left the non deployed servers in a bad state when updated.  For a rolling deployment I usually deploy to one, and then to the other two. I did this for the calendar update this afternoon.  It was ok for the two servers to still point at the engineering calendar while another pointed at only Lewis...  That is why I kept production for times when we can not roll and must do it in the early morning, and production_rolla and production_rollb to allow for at least one server to be up at all times..."
