          "body": "This was quite the investigation!\n\nThe query\n`select * from metadatavalue where resource_type_id = 0 and text_value IS NULL;`\nreturned no results for both the staging and dev server.\n\nThe query  `select * from metadatavalue where resource_type_id = 0 and text_value = '';` showed 1 result on the staging server, and 0 results on the dev server. Lynn corrected this entry. ([Staging](https://dataspace-staging.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01c821gn25b), [Dev](https://dataspace-dev.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01c821gn25b))\n\nWorking backwards from the example provided revealed that the problem wasn’t filenames that were NULL, but bitstreams that didn’t have a `dc.title` field, which is `resource_id` 64. **On the prod server there are 619 items that fall in this category.** They've been placed into this google sheet: \nhttps://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LhDt9ppgX_Q3uCqKhr3HZieLq12-Up1DlmQW5JrjxF8/edit?usp=sharing\n\nHere is the query:\n```sql\nSELECT handle,bitstream_id\nFROM handle \nINNER JOIN item ON (item.item_id = handle.resource_id)\nINNER JOIN item2bundle ON (item.item_id = item2bundle.item_id)\nINNER JOIN bundle2bitstream ON (item2bundle.bundle_id = bundle2bitstream.bundle_id)\nWHERE bitstream_id IN (\n     SELECT resource_id\n     FROM metadatavalue WHERE resource_type_id = 0 \n     GROUP BY resource_id \n     HAVING NOT (64 = ANY(ARRAY_AGG(metadata_field_id)))\n);\n```\n\nI'm moving away from this for now, but I would imagine we might want to figure out what our next steps are? I can include collection / community information so that we know what's exclusively Lynn's concern? Some of the metadata includes import information, from which we can grab filenames, so fixing this may be automatable. \n\nSide note: There were 635 on dev, 20 on staging, and (as mentioned above) 619 on prod. How exactly are dataspace databases being synced?"
