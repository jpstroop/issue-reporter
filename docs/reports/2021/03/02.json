It's possible there are other collections that predate the forms change, so maybe this ticket is really \"run a script to identify any volumes with collection membership and remove it\""

I tried in another collection and I got a site value. What I suspect is that the lookup function doesn't find a value. I would expect the hidden input field that it produces to be rendered with a blank value. However, the input field seems to never get rendered at all. If you've found an example of an HSVM item that renders the `<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"Site\" ...>` element in the request modal, let me know.   \r\n\r\n"
