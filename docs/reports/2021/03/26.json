We have a \"feedback\" link in the PULFA 2.0 site that has not seen activity in years, so I would want to make sure it gets use if we add it. \r\n\r\nI was under the impression that our strategy for inter-staff communication involved staff using Suggest a Correction, so I'm surprised that you are unhappy with its use. Have you asked staff to use the Slack channel instead? Were they resistant to that? Or are you saying that Slack is not sufficient either because it offers no way to track the feedback/suggestion?\r\n\r\nSeems like we may want to schedule a meeting to discuss this in more detail?\r\n\r\n"

The \"Ask Us\" button is really for reference questions and Suggest a Correction is only meant to communicate issues regarding description. We think it would be useful, based on recent communication we've received from staff, to have an option in addition to the pulfalight channel for staff to submit feedback related to site functionality as some staff seem hesitant to use slack and because of the convenience of referring to a specific page as an example. \r\n\r\nWould be happy to meet to discuss this. Thanks. "
