          "body": "In the checkin we said to remove the tmpl files and keep only the .rb files. After looking into this I rejected it as an option. I'm quoting my note from slack `I kept solid only the holding_library.tmpl file so that we don’t need to generate it every time.\r\nI rejected the idea of using the .rb files that we generate through the #generate method because they are being generated by retrieving data from the tables. With that said every time you start lando and you generate the .rb files using the tables from the database the tables would be empty and the generated .rb files would be empty.  Unless you also call the alma api every time you start lando so that you populate the tables.  We don’t want to call the alma api every time we run the app in development or test. So it is better to keep the tmpl files and use them through the #generate_from_templates method so that we will create the .rb files locally in case they don’t exist`.\r\nAlso this Pr addresses the removal of the double label in the orangelight display and updates the Location::Holdings table in bibdata. It also improves the code by removing unused lines of code and the generation of a nil file. \r\n\r\nIf we want to improve the way we generate the locations this should be part of a new issue. "

          "body": "We'd like to have a discussion about whether it would make sense to link out to alma's \"library card\" page instead of reimplementing this in blacklight. Arguments in favor of doing this are:\r\n\r\n1. The local implementation requires 5 API calls to build the display page. Note that this is 1/5th of the concurrency limit for API calls.\r\n2. There is functionality we cannot implement via the API, such as \"renew all\" (the api only provides single renewal, and again the concurrency limit) and up-front account limit notifications (e.g. \"You can't renew this because you have too many fines\" in the API is just \"renewable: false\")\r\n3. Using the alma page would release developer time as we move toward go-live.\r\n\r\nThere are a few considerations we'd need to iron out:\r\n1. What do we do with guest accounts? Provide them with usernames / passwords directly in Alma? Provide a minimal UI for them in blacklight (guests don't have as many privileges so this could be loans display only with one renewal at a time)? Just not provide an online account service?\r\n2. Others?\r\n\r\nWork for this issue is in progress on branch [2025-alma-account](https://github.com/pulibrary/orangelight/compare/2025-alma-account?expand=1). Setting aside / blocking for now until we get some feedback."
