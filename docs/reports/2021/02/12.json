Branch Library Ongoing project. Records now in MARC, but suppressed:\n\nHey Kim!\nThanks again for organizing the meeting. I’m sorry we didn’t get through everything we were hoping to get through! \n\n    So I’ll tell you why the records were entered into the catalog suppressed. When Peter and Mark were creating the loader to get the bib records into Voyager, Mark asked why we were adding bib records if we didn’t have anything for people to find. Jennifer and Peter decided that they would load the records as suppressed until there was images to connect to the bib in figgy.\n    I did bring up that we have the physical items and the bib records somehow need to also show that, but it didn’t go further. I’m not sure how we setup the physical items to connect to the bib and MFHD records. There are about 20-50 individual songs in a volume. Right now there is one main record for the valva collection and then barcodes for each volume within the collection. This is the record for the collection in the catalog: https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/2434779   It currently just points to the google document that was used to create the individual bib records for each song within the collection. So if we can find a way to make sure that each bib record for the songs are linked to the volume that’d be great, but I don’t know the best option. We would need to add a barcode to each song, but there are often two songs on one piece of paper within the volume. (it’s a bit confusing). I can pull out examples of everything if that helps."

Roel, I saw Julie in the hallway today and we discussed the Sinclair Hamilton smalls collection. I said the studio would work to include up to 40 items from this collection in their workflow for the next year. My understanding is this collection will be worked in when priority items are not at the forefront and when  hard deadlines do not have to be met (ex: exhibits, collaborative projects, promised launches like that of Emily Hale, etc..).  Roel, does this sound good to you as well?  All the best to you both and I hope you are having a lovely evening!\n\nKim\n\n"

The voyager helpers code which was uploading the files was timing out because of the excessive queries. This was fixed. \r\n3. After we fixed the above (@mzelesky and I), we realized that the rake task was uploading invalid marc recorcds to scsb, that scsb could not process. https://github.com/pulibrary/voyager_helpers/issues/120 This is also fixed now (according to @mzelesky, because he is able to upload valid records manually to scsb that they are processed)\r\n4. We only need to 1. Release a new version of voyager_helpers https://github.com/pulibrary/voyager_helpers/issues/123 and update the gem in marc_liberation.  2. Resume the rake task. https://github.com/pulibrary/marc_liberation/issues/1078"
