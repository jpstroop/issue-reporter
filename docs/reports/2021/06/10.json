To avoid creating multiple overlapping versions of the same objects with many duplicate files, having a way to hide/suppress individual pages seems like the most straightforward way to me."

Garbage collection seems to never clear up that reference, probably because of something in Valkyrie.\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nf = File.open(\"/opt/repository/files/c8/dc/7c/c8dc7cba826940c1af8807052fb12da6/4f16c4243.tif\")\r\n# Open in lsof = 3\r\nf = nil\r\nGC.start\r\n# Open in lsof = 0\r\n\r\nf = Valkyrie::StorageAdapter.find_by(id: \"disk:///opt/repository/files/c8/dc/7c/c8dc7cba826940c1af8807052fb12da6/4f16c4243.tif\")\r\n# Open in lsof = 3\r\nf = nil\r\nGC.start\r\n# Open in lsof = 3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis seems to be because the IO is part of an instance variable, so GC doesn't grab it?\r\n\r\n```ruby\r\nclass NewFile\r\n   attr_reader :io\r\n   def initialize(io)\r\n     @io = io\r\n   end\r\nend\r\n\r\nf = NewFile.new(File.open(\"/opt/repository/files/c8/dc/7c/c8dc7cba826940c1af8807052fb12da6/4f16c4243.tif\"))\r\n# lsof count = 3\r\nf = nil\r\nGC.start\r\n# lsof count = 3\r\n```"
