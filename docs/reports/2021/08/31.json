Isn't there a way to get the same barcode/size input for your process via uploading a text file?\r\nAlternately, redesign so that the operator can declare or select a size and then sequentially scan barcodes for that size. When finished with it, select the next size and scan.  (Our end-processing shelves are size-sorted.)  If barcodes are duplicated in a batch, take the last one and its size.

The thing I'm concerned about is that a text file inherently has no sets of checks for if a prefix is valid and doesn't have a clear way to fix things. Further, it means changing your workflow is disconnected from changing the application and will inevitably lead to silent workarounds or cases where we have to parse if the file is okay or not.\r\n\r\n> Alternately, redesign so that the operator can declare or select a size and then sequentially scan barcodes for that size.

The text file macro makes this barcode duplication check at some point and retains only the last one for further processing.\r\nWe intended to provide a clean text file to serve as input, created with minimal task load on the operator.

It is strange that the holding information for one of the holdings (`22897390520006421`) is different depending on where it comes in the response, in one instance it has information about a temp location for reserves whereas in the other it does not...for the exact same holding.\r\n\r\nMore to come.\r\n"

In hindsight this is an expected scenario but the code explicitly throws and exception when it happens because we had not decided what to do in this case (e.g. what is the availability of holding X if item X1 is available but item X2 is unavailable).\r\n\r\nAnother thing in common for these bib records is that all of them have at least one holding marked as a temporary location. That's really what forces bib data to try to calculate availability from the items (rather than using the data from the holding) and while aggregating the data from the items it bumps into the problem described in the previous paragraph.\r\n\r\nI'll submit a PR with some ideas."

But this will be a more complicated and riskier change so I would vote to do that separately so that we can test it extensively...because if we mess that one up the Request button won't show up if there is an Alma error or bug in our code."

It renders as `9.91214E+15` and when I look at the cell, I see the off-by-one value. So maybe there is some weird floating-point rounding going on? I'm not sure what we can do, but I think it will be pretty common to open the CSV files in Excel. I checked and Google Spreadsheets handles them just fine."
