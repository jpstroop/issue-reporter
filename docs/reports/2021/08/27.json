If this job is run on a set of physical Items, only the specific items in the set are withdrawn. Even if a bibliographic record has multiple holdings records in different libraries and each holdings record has items, only the items that are in the selected physical items set are withdrawn. Other items are not withdrawn.\r\nWhen running the Withdraw items job, Alma checks to determine whether an item has an open order. Items with open orders are not withdrawn by the Withdraw items job.

Don't use the pipeline at all. Probably messes with things like our paragraph separator and HTML-safe accessor.\r\n2. Create a new helper to render the values with headings and remove the headings from the display partials. Maybe we can just set the label to be an empty string and create another <dt>? I'll try that, but it's pretty messy.\r\n3. Create some sort of API in Blacklight to support one field representing multiple fields."
