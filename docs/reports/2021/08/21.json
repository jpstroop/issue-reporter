If you have a trick I would love to know it.\r\n\r\nAlthough I am realizing that I did not quite create this branch correctly, so maybe the restrictions for undergraduates were removed earlier and this is just clean up.  It is hard to test because anyone authorized to be on campus has always had pickup rights.  This change should only impact undergraduates that were never authorized to be on campus."
