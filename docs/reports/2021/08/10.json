The music librarian at Penn, Dick Griscom, who just retired last year, gave us a verbal OK to put it up on our site.\n\nWay forward: in order to migrate the structural metadata, we need a MARC record to ingest to in figgy.  @kelea99 sent request to cataloging issues with links to the PUDL item, the record at UPenn for the complete work, and search results for records describing the items we digitized here at PUL (T.12 a, b, suppl)*.  one record is available @cwulfman will migrate item/structure to figgy and it will be made available via the online catalog.\n\n*Brittany from Mendel is being kept in the loop and will also look for record examples that might help cataloging. \n\n\nPUDL: http://pudl.princeton.edu/objects/w9505053d\n\nUPenn complete work: https://franklin.library.upenn.edu/catalog/FRANKLIN_991827123503681\n\nBit that we have (examples from WorldCat): https://www.worldcat.org/title/ivan-susanin/oclc/474858008&referer=brief_results\n\n"
