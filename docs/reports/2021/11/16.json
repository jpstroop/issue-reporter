The setup for allowing email to princeton email addresses is well-defined and we will do that first; it may be all we need.\r\n\r\nFor sending email to non-princeton email addresses, the process is not well-defined. I could work on clarifying this but we should determine whether we need it, maybe as part of evaluating the success of the work done for princeton email addresses. A couple of considerations:\r\n- You can't log into DPUL without a network account\r\n- The link to the bookmarks page only shows if you are logged in\r\n  - Even if we changed this, bookmarks wouldn't persist beyond a session, so there could be some usability work to make sure folks without network accounts understand its impermanence.\r\n  - If we don't change it, still may be some usability work to do here because a person without a network account can create bookmarks but not view them.\r\n- I'm not sure what the implications are for our collaborators with proxy network accounts."
