This is somewhat misleading for the user.\r\n    No holdings statement is included in the AVA field for the temp location.\r\n\r\nUnless a different approach is taken about displaying item-level information in the record show page, there doesn't seem to be much choice in following the above pattern. This would mean the following can be implemented for the show page:\r\n\r\nA. \"Location has\" will be displayed for holdings where items don't exist at all.\r\nB. \"Location has\" will be displayed for holdings where there are all items in the permanent location.\r\nC. \"Location has\" will be displayed for holdings where there are some items in the permanent location [this will be inaccurate since the temp location items will be shelved separately, but it's how Alma returns it in the AVA field].\r\nD. \"Location has\" will not be displayed for holdings with items with locations that differ from the permanent location.\r\n\r\nThe \"location has\" statement is returned in the AVA fields (AVA $t), but it could also be indexed from the publishing jobs (the 866, 867, 868 fields)."
