I think moving the thumbnail up toward the bookmark checkbox, like that of the online catalog makes sense.  From what I can see, it is the bookmark that is in alignment with the title, followed by the thumbnail beneath, with less padding in between. Is this correct? I really like the online catalog's alignment :)  thumbnails below:\r\n- Orangelight\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-11-05 at 11 03 37 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45043014/140532773-77f2239b-00ec-48fa-a47b-2f472d555687.png)\r\n\r\n- DPUL\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-11-05 at 11 02 35 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45043014/140532832-0b0e106d-3ab9-4654-86ee-7ab14eeb59d8.png)\r\n"
