The isbn_display field is what we see in the catalog record page as ISBN.\r\nFor example: https://catalog-alma-qa.princeton.edu/catalog/99121576653506421/ (hardcover) should not display. In the staff_view https://catalog-alma-qa.princeton.edu/catalog/99121576653506421/staff_view the 3rd `020 z| 9781138388888 q| hardcover` has no $a.\r\n\r\nThis is also an issue in production. Would it be better to apply this change in the main branch and we pull it with the rebase?"
