Although if we are concerned about reducing some load on the Alma API we could have Blacklight handle processing the display of any location flagged for Aeon on the server side since the catalog knows what is or isn't Aeon location because it's loading the holding_location configuration values, particularly on the search results page. We are doing a similar thing on the server now to manipulate the label on the request button, https://github.com/pulibrary/orangelight/blob/ace3e1ba6188b85a091eac310adb82b18ac1cfe2/app/services/physical_holdings_markup_builder.rb#L297.
