We are open to your suggestions about which metadata field would be available and would work for this.\n\n- Yes, we can and @escowles , I believe, has done this.\n\nCan we change the rights statement for all items to ‚ÄúCopyright not Evaluated‚Äù from the current ‚ÄúNo Known Copyright.‚Äù\n\n- Yes we can\n\n We had hoped that we could seamlessly scroll through all of the images associated with a component rather than having to click on each individual image, but we realized that this structure might be necessary in order to display the metadata associated with each image‚Äîso that is fine if so.\n\n We would like to move forward with a DPUL exhibition for this collection, but it might make sense to first work on the Historical Postcard Collection exhibit because you have gotten us started with that and it may be less complicated than the photograph collection."

On 9/14/2020, @kelea99 wrote to Lynn, Alexis, and Ann Marie, telling them of the ingest of the MVWs and asking for their review.\r\n\r\nIn an email dated December 18, 2020 (subject RE: Grounds and Buildings MVWs and Historic Postcards DPUL test site ready for review), Lynn Durgin responded to @kelea99 's request for an update with the statement @kelea99 quotes above. In particular, she says\r\n\r\n>We had hoped that we could seamlessly scroll through all of the images associated with a component rather than having to click on each individual image, but we realized that this structure might be necessary in order to display the metadata associated with each image‚Äîso that is fine if so.\r\n\r\nThis sounds like they would like to abandon the MVW approach and ingest these as single items.  Is that correct, @kelea99 and @escowles ?"
