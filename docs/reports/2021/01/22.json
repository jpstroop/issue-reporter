This is a small service degradation and acceptable until we develop a plan for indexing.\r\n\r\nTalking to @mzelesky\r\n- To do this during a full index would require 300k extra API calls.\r\n\r\nBrainstorm of alternatives:\r\n- Do this during a 2nd pass on indexing where you find all the constituent records and add the holdings from their host records. This would require investigating turning on partial updates for solr.\r\n- If we could know that we always have the host records indexed first, then we could pull the holdings from them each time we hit a constituent record.\r\n  - We could manage 2 sets of dumps: (non-bound-with and host records) and constituent records; or host records and (non-bound-with and constituent records)."
