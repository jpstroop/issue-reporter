Otherwise you would have to add a lot of checking to remove fields that shouldn't be there.\r\n\r\nOne final note on this: it is possible to mark suppressed records as 'deleted' in the leader for the publishing job. This would be a more reliable way to exclude suppressed records than searching for a 950 field. This particular record is suppressed."
