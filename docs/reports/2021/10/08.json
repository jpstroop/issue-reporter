It looks like we'll probably need to run the same sort of script:\r\n1. configure a weekly job that exports KBART for portfolios to a directory on lib-sftp\r\n2. loop over the exported files, gathering their data and filenames\r\n3. append filenames to existing fields (as the required `interface_name`) in a single combined csv\r\n4. zip and push the resulting file (using their requested naming convention) to ftp.readcube.com. E.g. `EXPORT_PORTFOLIOS_PRINCETON_SFX_20210719064145.zip`\r\n\r\n@kevinreiss is it worth checking with Anywhere Access to see whether their requirements have changed?\r\n"
