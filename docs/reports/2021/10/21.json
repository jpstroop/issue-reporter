The funnel is often used do denote narrowing a search.\r\n\r\nA funnel icon would look something like https://www.flaticon.com/free-icon/filter_1159884?term=funnel&page=1&position=8&page=1&position=8&related_id=1159884&origin=tag (not sure exactly what icon font we use).\r\n\r\nScreenshot:\r\n![Screen Shot 2021-10-21 at 9 51 49 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/845363/138292559-d5f576e8-9299-43dd-905d-ea2044cbd44f.png)\r\n\r\n"

Fix the current mounting system:\r\n- [x] mount diglibdata1 only once, as `/mnt/solr_backup`\r\n- [ ] use NFS instead of CIFS\r\n- [x] ensure the owner of the `/mnt/solr_backup` directory is the local `deploy` user, which may have a different UID on each box\r\n- [x] update `/etc/fstab` so the new configuration will survive a reboot\r\n"
