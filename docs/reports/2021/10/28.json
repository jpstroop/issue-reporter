          "body": "Notes on my little dive into Alma SRU and our Availability API needs.\r\n\r\n* The data from the SRU comes in XML, there is no option to fetch JSON.\r\n* Whereas the API fields come in “human readable” form (e.g. title, author, place of publication) the fields in SRU are straight MARC fields (245bc, 776a, 264abc) when using the default `marcxml` format or any of the other MARC schemas. \r\n  * It is possible to request other record schemas (e.g. DC, MODS) that provide non-MARC fields but each of them is different. We’ll need to review what works best for us. \r\n  * Because the format is different from the API results, switching from the API to SRU will require some code changes to map to the new field names. \r\n  * However, since we only use availability data and not bib record descriptive data (title, author, etc) this might not be a problem.\r\n* The availability information (AVA and AVE fields) that comes in the SRU response is almost identical to what we get from the API. There is one little extra value (subfield u) in the API compared to what we get in the SRU, not sure if this will be significant for us :\r\n```\r\n<subfield code=\"u\">publishing_base_url undefined?u.ignore_date_coverage=true&amp;rft.mms_id=99124374163506421</subfield>\r\n```\r\n\r\nHere is an example of the data that we get for record [99124374163506421](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/99124374163506421) in both formats\r\n\r\n* [API response](https://gist.github.com/hectorcorrea/8f441f48fc406f193619fb1ee7e326bb#file-99124374163506421_api-json)\r\n* API - [the XML in the JSON anies field expanded](https://gist.github.com/hectorcorrea/8f441f48fc406f193619fb1ee7e326bb#file-99124374163506421_api_anies-xml)\r\n* [SRU response in XML](https://gist.github.com/hectorcorrea/8f441f48fc406f193619fb1ee7e326bb#file-99124374163506421_sru-xml)\r\n\r\nIt’s not clear to me that the SRU calls are faster (or slower) than the response times that we get from the API. A few sample tests gave response times around 2 seconds when querying batches of 10 MMS_IDs. As with the Alma API data seems to be cached so repeating a query gives faster response times.\r\n\r\nHere is  a sample query to fetch 10 records at once via SRU: \r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl https://princeton.alma.exlibrisgroup.com/view/sru/01PRI_INST?version=1.2&operation=searchRetrieve&recordSchema=marcxml&query=alma.mms_id=99112014383506421+or+alma.mms_id=99112014753506421+or+alma.mms_id=99112015033506421+or+alma.mms_id=99118724103506421+or+alma.mms_id=99125186219506421+or+alma.mms_id=99113684863506421+or+alma.mms_id=99121938583506421+or+alma.mms_id=99121389713506421+or+alma.mms_id=99125347328506421+or+alma.mms_id=99125136623506421\r\n```\r\n\r\n# In conclusion\r\nI am not sure this is worth implementing. \r\n\r\nThe only advantage that I see is that we could replace the calls to bibdata to calls straight to Alma (i.e. no PUL middle tier) since there is no API key needed when making the calls. But this is not something that we need or were after.\r\n\r\nSome of the disadvantages are:\r\n* We don’t gain much/anything in performance. \r\n* It will require parsing XML responses either in Ruby in bibdata or in Javascript in Orangelight.\r\n* The names of the fields are straight from MARC (this could be a problem if we want combined values in the title, author, or place of publication)\r\n"
