Getting all of Figgy onto V3 is a big task, so I just focused on Maps and getting it done fast.\r\n\r\nNot sure how content negotiation would work with clients, and even just  users who want to paste a URL into their browser and see the manifest. Is there a precedent for this? Maybe if V3 was the standard view, and you could content-negotiate a V2 manifest?\r\n\r\nDoing this in Elixir would be great, but I think probably best done as part of a larger migration to V3. Or more bluntly, that would take a lot of time and I just want to see locations on our map manifests!\r\n\r\nHere's what I have so far: https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/compare/scanned-map-v3\r\n\r\nMostly passes the prezi 3 validator (doesn't like the nil values that the IIIF gem spits out)."
