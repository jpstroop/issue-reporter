          "body": "Looking through the code, Full files that are imported through SCSB are https://github.com/pulibrary/bibdata/blob/55d3495c1bf4e26c8c2759dd921940e7d41f0871/app/models/scsb/partner_updates.rb#L48 processed and extracted in the `data/marc_liberation_files/partner_update_scratch` directory. The error that was generated was because the file existed and raised an error. We should override it in this case and have this error fail the process. I will open an issue for this. \r\nI confirmed with @hackartisan who has also seen the same error in the past. For now we deleted the files in `data/marc_liberation_files/partner_update_scratch` and deleted the unfinished `Full partner Recap Records` job so that is not stale in the events page. \r\nThe 2 extra events for 'Full partner Recap Records' were created because while the Scsb import job was still running in sidekiq we deployed twice in production (@hackartisan thanks for the observation). Unfortunately that causes sidekiq to restart. "
