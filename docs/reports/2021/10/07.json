My code is running in the process hierarchy looking the field tags and subfields and updating the offensive term before building the final string with the separator. This is running in the process_hierarchy method in princeton_marc.\r\n2. Point 1 means that I replace' Indians of North America' -> 'Indigenous peoples of North America' before the code for Indigenous studies run; as a result the Indigenous studies term will not be added where the term has already been replaced with 'Indigenous peoples of North America' because the merged code is looking for the full string of 'Indians of North America' with a separator when it has more subfields.\r\n\r\nAt this point we need to refactor either the merged code or my code considering also the source of the files we are parsing and what is more sustainable. The indigenous file seems that it is coming from oclc. Will it always be provided from oclc? Will we always need to look for the specific symbols or will we also be given a file from alma with different symbols for the subfields? \r\nIn my code I'm looking for 650$a with a second indicator 0 as well as for 6xx with second indicator 0 and subdivision $q based on the file that we were given https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191sqH8tqpc0EFv2l1U9mh1-S1K4YFrtUQAaUlWhb4eg/edit#gid=0 "
