I can't really add to the use case portion of this discussion.\n\nBut @cwulfman and I want to leave some implementation notes on next steps for ourselves for next week:\nWe've got a new `imported_metadata` field on the Version model. Next step is to populate it during the getty ingest scripts which were added in https://github.com/pulibrary/cicognara-rails/pull/354. In particular, we expect to add a test around https://github.com/pulibrary/cicognara-rails/pull/354/files#diff-8de88da2a1e2b66150c9d386ef5fc2daR31 that we're indexing a hash into `imported_metadata` with keys pulled from https://github.com/pulibrary/cicognara-rails/blob/3d648ffd5142bf246ab6f63d33b9c384a5943d42/app/controllers/catalog_controller.rb#L109-L131.\n\nTooling is set up to then present those hashes via solr documents in metadata divs on the show page.\n\nFinal step will be to hide / show those divs in response to click events on the tabs which currently control the viewer display.\n\nWe'll also need to explicitly test that the third case, where there are no versions but we want to still display the metadata, remains true."
