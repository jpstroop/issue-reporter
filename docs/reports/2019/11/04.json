This test is tricky because to connect to the live repo we'd need to give the tests access to the vaulted credentials (not sure how to do this) and because the checkout takes a long time due to the size of the repo. It might be possible to mock the svn response with a fixture but this isn't something any of us have tried with molecule. Inclination is to scrap this test for now.\r\n\r\nI'll open a new PR that adds the task to plantain."
