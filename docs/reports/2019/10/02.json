Add new sort options `sort_date_desc` and `sort_date_asc`. Remove current `sort_date` option.\n1. Run a rake task that iterates through every exhibit removing `sort_date` and adding in the new options.\n\nThis means exhibits won't have any date sort options in the short amount of time between deployment and completion of the rake task. @kelea99 is that acceptable? if not let me know and it's very easy to do it in 2 steps instead."

The only workaround would be to go to a fully local schema that incorporates our local validation rules. That would be very hard to maintain though, so I don’t recommend it.\r\n\r\nIt’s possible to associate multiple schemas with a document type, if that would be helpful. This would at least make error messages from both schemas show up at the same time. Let me know if you want me to walk you through the setup.\r\n\r\nRegine Heberlein\r\nLibrary IT Data Analyst\r\n609-258-6156\r\nheberlei@princeton.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: \"Regine I.

This doesn’t involve an edit to the schema file; rather, it requires a change to how processors set up their preferences on their machines. It looks like we can edit the cc_config file. I’ll investigate.\r\n\r\nhttps://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/21.1/ug-editor/topics/streamline-with-content-completion.html#streamline-with-content-completion\r\nhttps://www.oxygenxml.com/doc/versions/21.1/ug-editor/topics/configuring-content-completion-proposals.html\r\n\r\n\r\nRegine Heberlein\r\nLibrary IT Data Analyst\r\n609-258-6156\r\nheberlei@princeton.edu\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom: faithc <notifications@github.com>\r\nReply-To: pulibrary/pulfa <reply@reply.github.com>\r\nDate: Monday, September 30, 2019 at 3:04 PM\r\nTo: pulibrary/pulfa <pulfa@noreply.github.com>\r\nCc: \"Regine I.

These values show up when a user validates a file if there is an error; but they don't display in a pop-up window for users to select at the time of encoding as attribute values do via the EAD schema, for instance, unitdate @ type \"inclusive\" and \"bulk.\" Does that make sense?\r\n\r\n—\r\nYou are receiving this because you were mentioned.\r\nReply to this email directly, view it on GitHub<https://github.com/pulibrary/pulfa/issues/333?email_source=notifications&email_token=ABNKKUYLCXTWOJIUG6AAET3QMJESFA5CNFSM4I37BGP2YY3PNVWWK3TUL52HS4DFVREXG43VMVBW63LNMVXHJKTDN5WW2ZLOORPWSZGOD76XR5Q#issuecomment-536705270>, or mute the thread<https://github.com/notifications/unsubscribe-auth/ABNKKU4ZX7YYUZ5JFZXYK3DQMJESFANCNFSM4I37BGPQ>.\r\n"
