A few thoughts...\r\n\r\n- We should not preserve resource types that are only nested within other resources. Correct?\r\n- The existing preservation logic only preserves resources that are \"complete\"., however there are a number of resource types without a state property. We will need to change the logic for these. I assume it's preserve on save when there is no state.\r\n- There are handful of resources that I don't know if we should preserve or not (see below). \r\n\r\nResource | Preserve | Has State Property\r\n-- | -- | --\r\nCollection | Y | Y\r\nDateRange | N | N\r\nEphemeraBox | Y | Y\r\nEphemeraField | Y | N\r\nEphemeraFolder | Y | Y\r\nEphemeraProject | Y | N\r\nEphemeraTerm | Y | N\r\nEphemeraVocabularies | Y | N\r\nEvent |   | N\r\nFileSet |   | N\r\nMediaResource | Y | Y\r\nNameWithPlace | N | N\r\nNestedResource | N | N\r\nNumismaticAccession | Y | N\r\nNumismaticArtist | N | N\r\nNumismaticAttribute | N | N\r\nNumismaticCitation | N | N\r\nNumismaticCoin | Y | Y\r\nNumismaticFind | N | N\r\nNumismaticFirm | Y | N\r\nNumismaticIssue | Y | Y\r\nNumismaticLoan | N | N\r\nNumismaticMonogram | Y | N\r\nNumismaticNote | N | N\r\nNumismaticPerson | Y | N\r\nNumismaticPlace | Y | N\r\nNumismaticProvenance | N | N\r\nNumismaticReference | Y | N\r\nNumismaticSubject | N | N\r\nPreservationObject |   | N\r\nProxyFileSet |   | N\r\nRasterResource | Y | Y\r\nScannedMap | Y | Y\r\nScannedResource | Y | Y\r\nTemplate | Y | N\r\nTombstone |   | N\r\nVectorResource | Y | Y\r\nWorkflowNote | N | N"

The most convenient way to identify these is the resources with a state property, where we can preserve them when they are complete.\r\n2. Nested resources — I assume these are never preserved because they are preserved in their parent resources.\r\n3. Helper resources, e.g., most of the numismatic, ephemera, and controlled vocab fields, which should be preserved on every save.\r\n4. The preservation machinery itself, like Event, PreservationObject, Tombstone. I don't know if these need to be preserved (maybe they need to be preserved so we can access historical versions if we do a complete restore?) — but there may be complications in preserving them and preventing recursive preservation processes.\r\n5. FileSet is probably a special case — needs to be preserved, but only as part of a parent \"work\"."
