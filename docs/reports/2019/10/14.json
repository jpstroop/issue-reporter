Both stated that they encountered an infinite loop when they tried to access that particular webpage (1 employee experienced this all day on Saturday, and another employee experienced this on Sunday). Just for my information, does IT run maintenance tasks or backups on the repository over the weekend? If so, I would need to let some of our employees know. Thanks, take care.  "
