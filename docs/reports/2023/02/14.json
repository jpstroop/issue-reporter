And actually, it looks like there are 880 notes with type “restricted,” not 883. It looks like I can't attach xml files here. Should I email you the revised EAD file I used to do the search?

If so, I don't think that's possible in the current version without deleting the entire restriction. Does that change things?\r\n- are you looking to delete only restrictions of a certain type?\r\n\r\nHere is an XPath that will get you any leaf components within Series 1 that have an accessrestrict, which is what I'm understanding you're trying to get at--perhaps review that and let me know how it doesn't match your search criteria (since the number of results doesn't match yours)?
