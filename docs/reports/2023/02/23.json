This happened since PUL adopted decentralized digitization practices and uploaded images from patron requests to Figgy as well. We would like to curate a DPUL collection <https://dpul.princeton.edu/cotsen> that contains all _complete_ digital surrogates of Cotsen's holdings.\r\n\r\nI hope this explains the context of the request for report? We sorely need a good help with clearing up errors we keep spotting in DPUL concerning the organization of Cotsen titles. Keyword searching proves not reliable/exhaustive. Please let me know any further clarification we can provide. Thanks!\r\n\r\nMinjie"
