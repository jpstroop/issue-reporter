To what extent would Rails controllers fulfill the role of the API (i.e., the views would constitute the UI)? Would scrupulously creating controller endpoints for any data that controllers or views/helpers fill the gaps?\r\n2. I've seen token-based auth folded into controllers so browsers and automated clients use the same endpoints, but I think it's more common to have different endpoints.\r\n3. One of the ramifications of having a significant external command-line/API customer base that Matt, Kate, and I discussed recently is that any backwards-incompatible changes would potentially break their integrations. Maybe this argues against considering Rails controllers the API?\r\n4. What are the best practices for having a separate, versioned API?\r\n5. I'm not sure that having a \"Middle Layer\" between the UI/API and the backend is a requirement, or if it's one possible approach to making sure that users don't have unmediated access to MediaFlux just because they are using a command-line tool or API integration. Basically, maybe this app is the \"Middle Layer\"?"

If they work, can we agree just to stay with that, and have an assurance that we’ll get a fresh baked image every couple months? Or is it important to move to Java?\r\n> Testing will be particularly reliant on mocking the MF interface… unless we want to pull that mocking down, so it’s the wrapper that gets mocked.\r\n\r\nConclusion was that we'll know more after the meetings next week:\r\n\r\n> This is an open question – but this comes done to our decision as a team. Would like to know more about why he recommends the Java environment.\r\n\r\nNo other immediate action"
