Any existing applications where the \"accessible\" checkbox was checked now no longer display on the locker assignment page.\r\n> \r\n> For example: https://lockers-and-study-spaces-staging.princeton.edu/locker_applications/835/assign -- the user requested an accessible locker before this branch was deployed, but it doesn't display on this screen, so the staff member wouldn't know about their request.\r\n\r\nThanks @sandbergja , that's a good point. I can see two ways of addressing that:\r\n\r\n1. Add a migration that adds unspecified \"Accessible: true\" to some value in the new `accessibility_needs` field - e.g. `['Unspecified accessibility need]` or something like that\r\n2. Display both the old Accessible boolean and the new accessibility_needs array on the show view"
