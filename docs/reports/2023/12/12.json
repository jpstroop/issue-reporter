Which of these three options would be the best way to go? \r\n\r\n1. Figure out a way to do this on the server side. (I'm struggling to do this ATM)\r\n2. Add a handler in the Vue layer that checks to see if they already exist in the DOM when you click \"Request this Box\"\r\n3. Add a handler in the Vue layer that strips out duplicate values when you submit the cart. \r\n\r\nI've advised Atlas that Location value can vary amongst individual request items on a given POST containing more than a single object. They are getting back to me on that question, they may have to enhance Aeon to deal with this from sites that use Remote POSTs and Single Sign On. As a test for now we can just submit that value as a constant. "

We will also eventually have a way to update provenance values via interoperation with other systems. But in this preliminary phase, the editable fields are limited, as shown in #113 and #248. All we need is for this issue is for the \"Project Details\" page to have a place to display \"Automatic Settings\" and \"Provenance\" values (which will be set for a given project by other means).\r\n\r\nRight now, we just show roles and (project) description:\r\n![image](https://github.com/pulibrary/tiger-data-app/assets/66128387/9498c9e0-e743-4c82-ad67-e0b7783265b6)\r\n\r\nBut what we need is a more complete overview of the project details, like this:\r\n![image](https://github.com/pulibrary/tiger-data-app/assets/66128387/a40061f1-3f11-4bd5-8ef9-12ea8ac3141b)\r\n\r\nAnd again, this issue is just about getting the headings cleaned up: \"Roles\", \"Description\", \"Automatic Settings\", and \"Provenance\""
