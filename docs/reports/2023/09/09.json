So this bug could be fixed by:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Creating a test that recreates this issue in [this file](https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight-marc/blob/8cb8050327b079304b81e9531a4a738efc3fe1e6/spec/models/concerns/blacklight/marc/document_export_spec.rb)\r\n- [ ] Writing the code to fix that test\r\n- [ ] Opening a PR to blacklight-marc gem\r\n- [ ] Once that PR is merged and released, upgrading our version of blacklight-marc to one that includes the fix."
