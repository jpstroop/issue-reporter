Problems to solve are knottier issues that are going to require some investigation.\r\nThe remaining tabs are each a collection, and contain barcodes and corresponding box numbers exported from Alma.\r\n\r\nThe next step in this cleanup would be to do the simple barcode imports. To support that, I'm going to add here a list of call numbers, and if you could please go to the tab associated with each call number in the spreadsheet, and import the barcodes therein to ASpace, that would be great! Note that there are call numbers in those tabs that are not ready to import yet, so please just use the list of call numbers below.\r\n\r\nThen once we've resolved the \"Problems to solve\" we may give you additional call numbers to import bar codes to ASpace.\r\n\r\nsome of these issues may be complicated and take time to sort out, so unfortunately it may be a bit before we can implement the new process you've designed.\r\n\r\n- [ ] MC165\r\n- [ ] AC240\r\n- [ ] AC283\r\n- [ ] AC154\r\n- [ ] AC161\r\n- [ ] C0129\r\n- [ ] TC019\r\n- [ ] TC022\r\n- [ ] TC059\r\n- [ ] TC064\r\n- [ ] TC091\r\n- [ ] TC110\r\n- [ ] TC111\r\n- [ ] TC112\r\n- [ ] LAE119\r\n- [ ] MC104\r\n\r\nThank you!!!\r\n\r\n"

It also allows folks time to know when not to kick off large ingests. For SC and Mudd Colleagues, it allows them to plan for no PDF downloads during that time, until ticket #2866 is closed.\r\n\r\n### Bad day(s) for Read Only Figgy mode\r\nFridays\r\n### Reasoning for bad day(s)\r\nFridays are scheduled ingest times for Branch libraries dependent on structured workflows to get the jobs done like Lewis and larger scanning operations, Like Microforms. \r\n\r\n### Where to distribute information for Read Only?\r\n- Email to affected stakeholders (see above)\r\n- #digital_library Slack Channel\r\n- Banner in the Catalog re: CDL downtime (coordinate with DACs)\r\n\r\n### What to include in message\r\n- Date / time/ expectation\r\n- What does Read Only Mean? What can/can't you do in Figgy?\r\n- Where to post questions/comments/concerns: #digital_library Slack channel. \r\n- Please tell your friends and colleagues who may want to know! Sharing is caring."
