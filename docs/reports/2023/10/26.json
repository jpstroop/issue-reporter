We want the key-command/shortcut to zoom on the selected item, but what if both are selected? Do we only allow one to be selected? Also, if we put the Zoom icon/button on the Gallery Item, as we do on the TreeItems, we need to change the Lux Gallery component to allow for zoom. This is better than the zoom being in the toolbar given keyboard navigation will make it hard to return focus to the toolbar. "
