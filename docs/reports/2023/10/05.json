Or should it maybe be \"Resource Health: ...\" (values are \"Healthy,\" \"In Process,\" and \"Needs Attention\")\r\n3. What about the error message that might be stored on a file? Seems like we should use `processing_status` to display \"In Process\" for the derivatives, and `error_message` to display \"Needs Attention\"\r\n4. Do we still want the banner display that says \"Files Processed: ...\" at the top of a page? Do we want the health report to now incorporate that message? It would require an extra click to see it."

The config importer https://github.com/pulibrary/researchdata/blob/main/sites/default/config/migrate_plus.migration.event_rss_importer.yml is configured to treat the dates as America/New_York which is how libguides provides them. Drupal is treating the date values as UTC values and converting them to Eastern time. Things we tried.\n\n- The site's default timezone is set to Eastern time, we changed this to UTC to see if that that impacting importing. \n- We removed the importers configuration to treat incoming dates as America/New_York time. \n\n\nNeither had any impact. Possible next times.\n\n- [ ] See if we can explicitly tell the rss importer from Drupal's migrate module to NOT convert any dates values \n- [ ] Research the topic further in Drupal's migrate module forums and stack overflow. \n- [ ] Since this worked at one time (the plugin configuration has remained unchanged since 2020) confirm if Springshare ever at one time provided date values in UTC.
