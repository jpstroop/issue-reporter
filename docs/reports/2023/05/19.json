It was developed for v3.2 but we're on v3.3. \r\n\r\nThese are the three things it does:\r\n\r\n1. ANW-1495: Support for Local Access Restriction Type in spreadsheet importer\r\n2. ANW-1489: URIs in EAD exports\r\n3. NO JIRA: Support for Local Access Restriction Type and structured restriction dates in RDE\r\n\r\nThe shim was developed for core. If the functionality is going to be part of 3.4, then we can (and should) turn the plugin off when we upgrade."
