(One of them is a Harvard copy. I visited [hollis.harvard.edu](https://hollis.harvard.edu/primo-explore/sourceRecord?vid=HVD2&docId=01HVD_ALMA212143122110003941) to find its source marc record)\r\nMMSID [99125348431306421](https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog?utf8=%E2%9C%93&search_field=all_fields&q=99125348431306421) has **041 a| eng** only, and is not tagged as Indigenous Languages.\r\n\r\nSecond, my analysis also exposes some encoding errors in the 041 fields of bib records. Lumped constructions like\r\n\r\n- 041 $a algeng\r\n- 041 $a engspanah\r\n\r\nmay be found in older records (and I suspect a higher presence in SCSB records), and would be skipped by the tagging project. \r\nWould it be possible to loosen up the matching criteria a tiny bit to scoop up such records as well?\r\n"
