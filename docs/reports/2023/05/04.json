However, UV only implemented the rtl direction feature for the metadata info pane, not for the leftPanel \"Contents\" iiif-tree-component.\r\n\r\nCode references:\r\n\r\n- the TreeView in the leftpanel module uses TreeNode for the elements of the table of contents https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/86f2cd47598ed2b2cef6b30fd3dc706b0c8b9807/src/content-handlers/iiif/modules/uv-contentleftpanel-module/TreeView.ts\r\n- The TreeNode itself is defined in manifesto: https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/manifesto/blob/6e355e34c38b64b9cf9c366d6ff60006db341968/src/TreeNode.ts\r\n  - the label is set in the constructor, making it much more difficult to override the behavior here, to the extent that it's either not actually possible or really not a good idea.\r\n- Here's some code showing how it works in the metadata info pane: https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer.github.io/blob/85dac1a4274f53659ba136c2bcd7ce1ab8c9d908/vendor/uv/lib/iiif-metadata-component.js#L375-L382\r\n- language direction configuration referenced in the UV ticket: https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/67ada49f6d866a51ab173d7166f6ddf04fffb471/src/content-handlers/iiif/extensions/uv-mediaelement-extension/options/en-GB.json#L50\r\n\r\nNote that @tpendragon also tried just putting html as the manifest value, but that resulted in an error.\r\n\r\nThe proposed path forward is (not necessarily in this order):\r\n* [ ] Work on UV upstream to implement the required feature, possibly in collaboration with someone in the UV community.\r\n* [x] Migrate from webpacker to vite (https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/issues/5734)\r\n* [ ] Update figgy to use the latest UV release, ensuring we carry over local customizations (see #5778)\r\n\r\nHowever, this path forward is a bigger project than we had hoped and the work will need to undergo prioritization again."

I removed the color of the card outline that corresponds to the error or warning since they can be mixed.\r\n\r\nOne thing to note is that I'm assuming DLS is not notified of a fixity failure and that the user must contact DLS to resolve it.

Once it's reported, it displays \"Reported\" and is no longer actionable.\r\n\r\nWe will need to display the following error messages:\r\n\r\n- Repairing Derivatives\r\n- Repairing Local Fixity\r\n- Repairing Cloud Fixity\r\n- Derivatives Failed | Report\r\n- Local Fixity Failed | Report\r\n- Cloud Fixity Failed | Report\r\n\r\n![filemanager-fixity5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/609368/236327234-d679073a-9156-43fd-a80b-818060def9f5.jpg)\r\n\r\n"
