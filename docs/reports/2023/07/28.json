For instance - is it enough to ingest the video, make it playable, but not render it for non-staff.\r\n> How does someone request captions?\r\n\r\n- Captions for video should be required for completion of an object in figgy not marked as \"Private\" visibility. Minimum metadata is required before ingest or completion of objects in figgy as a best practice. Captions for video should be just as important, if not moreso, due to legal ramifications for their absence. \r\n\r\n> When requesting captions, what happens?\r\n\r\n- Needs research. \r\n\r\n> How fast do captions need to turn around in?\r\n\r\n- without captions, objects should not marked as anything but \"Private\" visibility. Turnound time will be dependent on the primary stakeholder.\r\n\r\n> What kind of captions do we support?\r\n\r\n- format mentioned by @tpendragon : vtt (and/or?? srt?? scc?? ttml?? )\r\n- Language(s)/Script(s): Multi lingual collections are being proposed. \r\n\r\n> How do we model captions in Figgy? Presumably it's a separate file - how do we say that the video \"1.mp4\" is linked to the caption \"1-caption.vtt\", if there can be multiple videos in a single ScannedResource\r\n\r\n- This would be a cataloging questions as much as an ingest question. For multiple tapes/cds, would it be ingested as a MVW? or would a different workflow  be necessary for video (and audio?)?\r\n\r\n> If a video gets uploaded without an associated caption file, what should Figgy do? Prevent marking complete? Prevent marking anything but private?\r\n\r\n- Only Private option as default.  Get user/administration feedback on completion question.  If there are no captions, are we willing to still provide access via VRR/OARSC for the private material? If so, completion of private video with no captions would be allowed. \r\n\r\n> For video that HAS no audio (silent films), what's best practice for captions? Do we still need a caption that says there's no audio or something, or is it just not an issue?\r\n\r\n- needs research\r\n\r\n> Where are we going to put all these derivatives? The Isilon?
