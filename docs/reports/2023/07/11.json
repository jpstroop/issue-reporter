For example, there could be a collection-level warning noting the existence of harmful content and a note at a lower level with explicit information about particular materials, if that makes sense. For example, the collection-level warning for TC040 is superseded by the note at [TC040_c00001](https://findingaids.princeton.edu/catalog/TC040_c00001). "
