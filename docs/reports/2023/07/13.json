          "body": "Some preliminary considerations to discuss with DACS and Alma teams:\r\n1. Alma currently only has item records for SC ReCAP collections, not for everything.\r\n2. We are currently not sending items as part of the nightly aspace2alma. \r\n3. To automate this process, we would need to modify the nightly process to include items. Question: would we want to *only* include the ReCAP locations? Probably.\r\n4. Because Alma doesn't reject duplicate barcodes that come in as part of an import job, we need to front-load a deduplication process. (Let's triple-check this. It is too stupid to be true.)\r\n5. The silver lining is that everything that is going to ReCAP must be barcoded, so the deduplication can safely be done on barcode, even if Alma doesn't do it for us.\r\n6. As @mzelesky suggests, we could run an export job for SC items in ReCAP locations that gets uploaded to lib-sftp. Question: what would be the failsafe in case the items export job or upload to lib-sftp fails? (An outdated file on lib-sftp would result in a duplicate items upload to Alma because it would not reflect items that have been imported to Alma in the meantime.) We need some sort of \"burn after reading\" mechanism.\r\n7. The aspace2alma job would then have to grab the file from there first, dedupe on barcode, and send back to lib-sftp only the items not found in Alma. Failsafe could be that it doesn't find a file, it exits.\r\n9. On the Alma end, we need to set the (currently manual) import job to run on a schedule"
