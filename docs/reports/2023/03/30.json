The user who is not being loaded is not part of the absence management system so does not have an entry in this file. The loading process is possibility failing because of this condition. Reviewing the code to load a new user is probably the place to look first. \n\nIf this is the cause a potential fix would be to look at the column \"Absence System Code\" in the active daily staff report. If a user has a value of \"OT\" in this column they will NOT be found in the absence management report and you can assume they have zero balances for the leave types. All other users will have the \"AM\" code. "
