What is the end goal with this refactor? / Could you provide more guidance on what code I should be looking to replace? I wondered if it was some of the CSV class calls at first, but csv_report.rb also uses the CSV class, so I wasn't sure.\r\n2. The new csv_report.rb writes converts the data to CSV format and writes it to a path, but it's unclear to me what the current reports_controller.rb does‚Äîis it also writing the data to a path? \r\n3. If so, how do I find this path so I can pass it to the new `CSVReport#write`? I see the file name is passed in to `to_csv` in the current controller (lines 20, 32, 47 in reports_controller.rb), which I'm guessing would be the end of the path, but what else should I pass into `Rails.root.join`? (I don't know where the CSV is supposed to end up/can't tell where it's going in the current controller code.)\r\n\r\nThank you! And if it's easier to just talk about this after I'm back, that works too. "

I'd hope to replace the code that does the \"turn objects into a csv\" work with calls to the new class.\r\n2. the controller sends the csv as a download (see https://api.rubyonrails.org/v7.0.4.2/classes/ActionController/DataStreaming.html#method-i-send_data)\r\n3. We'll probably need to update the new class to be able to provide the csv directly to support this use case. The file name you see on lines 20, etc, is the file name passed to `send_data` as a hint to the browser for what the file should be saved as. \r\n\r\nWe can talk more more pair when you're back."
