Due to all the PULFA records loading every day, I could create a 'normalization rule' that changes the indicator to 1 if it's blank, and that would likely update all the records with blank indicators.\r\n@regineheberlein Would it be appropriate for the PULFA records to have the first indicator of the 583 field to be changed to a 1 if it is blank?\r\n\r\nI would think having one rule for the action notes would be better than doing one thing for PULFA records and another for everything else."

Local fixity is checked on the primary file:\r\nhttps://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/blob/main/app/jobs/local_fixity_job.rb#L94\r\n\r\nwhich is one of either `original_file`, `preservation_file`, or `intermediate_file`:\r\nhttps://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/blob/main/app/models/file_set.rb#L93\r\n\r\nSimilarly, the cloud preserver creates binary nodes for each of those file types:\r\nhttps://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/blob/main/app/services/preserver.rb#L75\r\n\r\nHowever, it seems to me that there is always only **one** primary file type per FileSet. Is this true?\r\n\r\nRegardless, I feel that checking fixity only on the primary file is sufficient.\r\n\r\nThoughts?"
