Probably the `spec/system/root_spec.rb` is just so there's something that CI can run. It's probably still nice to have that, if we comment it as like an example that should be changed or removed, so that someone could check CI for their new project."

Is anyone aware of documented upgrades? I’m mainly concerned with how and/or if Manifests continued to be published at the same URI or if institutions choose to publish v2 and v3 at separate URIs to maintain a past record.

Close to 130 items will be affected, so it had better be done by batch work if possible.\n\nPlease let me any questions.

However, UV only implemented the rtl direction feature for the metadata info pane, not for the leftPanel \"Contents\" iiif-tree-component.\r\n\r\nCode references:\r\n\r\n- the TreeView in the leftpanel module uses TreeNode for the elements of the table of contents https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/86f2cd47598ed2b2cef6b30fd3dc706b0c8b9807/src/content-handlers/iiif/modules/uv-contentleftpanel-module/TreeView.ts\r\n- The TreeNode itself is defined in manifesto: https://github.com/IIIF-Commons/manifesto/blob/6e355e34c38b64b9cf9c366d6ff60006db341968/src/TreeNode.ts\r\n  - the label is set in the constructor, making it much more difficult to override the behavior here, to the extent that it's either not actually possible or really not a good idea.\r\n- Here's some code showing how it works in the metadata info pane: https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer.github.io/blob/85dac1a4274f53659ba136c2bcd7ce1ab8c9d908/vendor/uv/lib/iiif-metadata-component.js#L375-L382\r\n- language direction configuration referenced in the UV ticket: https://github.com/UniversalViewer/universalviewer/blob/67ada49f6d866a51ab173d7166f6ddf04fffb471/src/content-handlers/iiif/extensions/uv-mediaelement-extension/options/en-GB.json#L50\r\n\r\nNote that @tpendragon also tried just putting html as the manifest value, but that resulted in an error.\r\n\r\nThe proposed path forward is (not necessarily in this order):\r\n* Work on UV upstream to implement the required feature, possibly in collaboration with someone in the UV community.\r\n* Migrate from webpacker to vite (https://github.com/pulibrary/figgy/issues/5734)\r\n* Update figgy to use the latest UV release, ensuring we carry over local customizations\r\n\r\nHowever, this path forward is a bigger project than we had hoped and the work will need to undergo prioritization again."
