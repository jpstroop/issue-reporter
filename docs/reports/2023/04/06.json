          "body": "We found that non-MVWs have a value for iiif_tilesource once they're saved by trevor, but MVWs do not. This makes https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight/blob/main/app/views/spotlight/sir_trevor/blocks/_solr_documents_carousel_block.html.erb#L13 work for non-mvws, and a larger image is displayed. Note that neither is getting the full_image_url value.\r\n\r\nThat all happens in https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight/blob/main/app/javascript/spotlight/admin/iiif.js\r\n\r\nBut it seems too hard to make that work for MVWs. We're already doing it on the ruby side, so let's use what we already have.\r\n\r\nPlan:\r\n\r\n1. write a test on the autocomplete endpoint to ensure it returns a full_image_url. Maybe add something around https://github.com/pulibrary/dpul/blob/403a9311d1ec21d1544588fcc5ad1e4ed5c8fa4e/spec/features/catalog_spec.rb#L66\r\n1. Make autocomplete return full_image_url_ssm by setting the field list in the initializer. Add a `fl` to the setting as seen in https://github.com/projectblacklight/spotlight/blob/a29b6bd3dc1e97fcc8f49a0273c90516af4d3f49/lib/generators/spotlight/templates/config/initializers/spotlight_initializer.rb#L32\r\n1. Index the full image url at a slightly larger size. see https://github.com/pulibrary/dpul/blob/403a9311d1ec21d1544588fcc5ad1e4ed5c8fa4e/app/services/iiif_manifest.rb#L43-L47\r\n"
