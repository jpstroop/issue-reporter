There is a prospect to bring bibliographic level data for the constituent records into the Aeon request.  \r\n\r\nSo I think we could extract following fields reliably: ItemAuthor, ItemTitle, ItemSubTitle, ItemDate, ItemEdition, ItemISxN, ReferenceNumber. \r\n\r\nI'm not sure how we'd extract the other data from a constituent record the values for ItemVolume, ItemIssue, ItemPages, ItemNumber since those are at the holding or item level data which only exist under a host record. I'm not exactly sure what ItemCitation is in this context. "

We could also use this to possible create a hash of constituent bibliographic level parameters taken from the solr document to pass over to the request form that can be used to override values from the host record that would otherwise be submitted to another system like Aeon.
