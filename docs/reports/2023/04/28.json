          "body": "This may or may not be relevant, but I thought it worth mentioning here just in case:\r\n\r\nI've looked into other reports of lag in ASpace and newly-created objects not becoming available in the UI since yesterday. I went in thinking it's an indexing thing, possibly related to bulk updates on Agents I've been running this week. However, I now think this issue is more specific to top_containers.\r\n\r\nHere's how I'm arriving at this suspicion:\r\n\r\n- Lyrasis checked the ASpace and SOLR servers for us and the logs, and Blake says there's nothing in there to indicate that indexing is or recently was slow. \r\n- I've followed up on all the reports of disappearing objects in the UI, and the only ones that have stuck (i.e. that I can reproduce, and that I can't exclude as unrelated or mere oversight) are top_containers.\r\n- Staff reports of sluggish performance came in after Lynn had reported the AbID 405\r\n\r\nSo I think whatever is going on has to do with top_containers. I'll ask Blake to take a closer look with that angle. If I learn anything more, I'll post it here.\r\n"
