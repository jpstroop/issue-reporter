Place names are always hierarchical and always in their 'natural order'.\r\n  a. LCSH: Fuji, Mount (Japan)\r\n  b. FaST: Japan -- Mount Fuji\r\n2. Name-title headings are formed in FaST by starting with the title, then placing the name after.\r\n  a. LCSH: Vonnegut, Kurt. Slaughterhouse-five\r\n  b. FaST: Slaughterhouse-five (Vonnegut, Kurt)\r\n3. In general, FaST consists of the individual facets of assigned LCSH split into the 9 segments listed above.\r\n  a. LCSH: 650  _0 $a Internal migrants $z China $z Beijing $v Fiction.\r\n  b. FaST:\r\n    1. 650  _7 $a Internal migrants.\r\n    2. 651  _7 $a China $z Beijing.\r\n    3. 655  _7 $a Fiction.\r\n\r\nThere are other differences, but those are the most significant.\r\n\r\nI am running some scripts to gather data on how FaST is currently used at PUL.\r\n1. Find records that do not have LCSH/LCGFT but have FaST headings.\r\n2. Of records that have LCSH/LCGFT and FaST, which records have headings unique to the FaST vocabulary that aren't directly represented by LCSH/LCGFT? This will also show all FaST headings on records with both vocabularies.\r\n\r\nMy hope is that these analyses will be used to inform us how to implement this request and its priority."
