The day before, the process stopped somewhere in repo 5, i.e. advanced farther before it stopped. This suggests a connection or network outage rather than a data error.\r\n\r\nI checked with Lyrasis about outages, but they're seeing nothing in their server and API logs. \r\n\r\nManual re-run succeeds again this morning.\r\n\r\nI'm wondering whether this could be something on lib-jobs?"
