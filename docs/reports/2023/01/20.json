Maybe it should just say, \"for fixity check dates please see the file manager\" with a link to that page?\r\n\r\nthere may also be some special cases around multi volume works here that we need to think about. In that case we'd need to direct folks to the individual volume resource show pages, and perhaps from there to the file manager for a given volume."

I think this whole page could be redesigned but in the interest of getting this preservation work done, this mock-up is intended to be a way forward with minimal reworking. I'm struggling a bit with the indicator language since a file could potentially have problems with local, cloud, and derivatives and it would be hard to find space for all of them without extending the card element for that file and messing with the grid consistency. Also, it needs attention to color and icons, but don't want to go down that path until I get some feedback on the general approach."

Does it go to the file set page, where we have more info on what the options might be? Does it do something different for a fixity failure vs a derivative failure?"

Happy to swap if these are not the desired semantics\r\n- Show author UID in messages. Partially addresses #863.\r\n- Two view tests, corresponding to the two partials, that cover the features listed above.\r\n- I've marked this as resolving #676. Additional tweaks may be requested, but I think we've gone far enough with the provided examples.\r\n\r\n<img width=\"344\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-19 at 10 41 46 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/730388/213613373-fcb89be7-0a64-4c84-acf1-b7d1cc9b7b1b.png\">\r\n\r\n<img width=\"557\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2023-01-19 at 10 41 58 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/730388/213613379-7ec59e3d-27d5-4bf2-ad15-1f92b48ac810.png\">\r\n\r\n"
