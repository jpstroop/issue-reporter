For example, if there are 3 file sets, on a resource, there would be 3 preservation objects for the file sets plus 1 for the resource. The FixityRequestor randomly selects a bunch of preservation objects to check fixity on. So these 3 files (plus the resource metadata itself) could have been queued for checks on wildly different dates.  What is the \"as of\" date? and what is the \"previously checked\" date?\r\n\r\n"

It should only be the provenance that has this appearance and message feature should be more consistent with how messages typically look. Regarding messages, I just wrote a ticket for changes to the messaging feature that was discussed in our last feature refinement meeting. Bess just took a look at it and said the ticket was actionable. You might also want to have a look: #823. Please feel welcome to comment or ask questions.  "
