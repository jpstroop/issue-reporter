You can see here what we do to import the files from DataSpace (https://github.com/pulibrary/pdc_discovery/blob/main/lib/traject/dataspace_research_data_config.rb#L393-L419). Here is an example XML of what we get from DataSpace (https://github.com/pulibrary/pdc_discovery/blob/main/spec/fixtures/astrophysical_sciences.xml) -- files are under `bitstreams`. We don't need an exact structure, but that should give you an idea of what we currently get. This is an example of how it looks on PDC Discovery https://datacommons.princeton.edu/discovery/catalog/155547.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"

          "body": "Notes from some digging today:\r\n\r\n- The error message ~~seems to indicate that a long-running Lua script is still in progress~~ indicates that some process is keeping the Redis server busy when pulfalight is trying to connect at these times. So whatever is happening is likely happening on lib-redis, not on the pulfalight boxes.\r\n- There's nothing useful in `/var/log/redis/redis-server.log` on lib-redis, not even a line about the error.\r\n~~- We have two projects that use Lua (that I can find): special_collections and pul_library_drupal.~~ \r\n~~- This [SO post](https://serverfault.com/questions/999431/how-to-fix-the-redis-is-busy-running-a-script-error) suggests we could modify the global `lua-time-limit` for the Redis server (default 5,000 ms). There's no current entry for this config setting in `/etc/redis/redis.conf` on lib-redis.~~\r\n- However, this [article](https://dzone.com/articles/redis-transactions-amp-long-running-lua-scripts) defines the `lua-time-limit` as the amount of time Redis rejects client commands to allow a script to complete. After this limit is reached, if the script continues to execute, Redis accepts client commands but returns the `BUSY` error. So updating the `lua-time-limit` won't fix the problem we're seeing.\r\n- This [GitHub issue](https://github.com/nyagato-00/predictor/issues/41) suggests we could increase the Redis client timeout (default 5 seconds), like this: `Redis.new timeout: 30`.\r\n~~- Alternatively, we could try to optimize the Lua scripts to run more quickly.~~\r\n- Looking at the output of `SLOWLOG GET` on the redis server shows several entries. They are not Lua scripts, though, they are queries from library-prod. The output is not easy to parse, but if we need to dig deeper, this is a place to start. See https://bobcares.com/blog/redis-slow-log/ and https://docs.redis.com/latest/rs/clusters/logging/redis-slow-log/. "
