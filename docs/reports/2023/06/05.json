Alma can give us a public key we can register on each box to use key-based auth instead when connected from the Alma environment. @mzelesky and I gave key-based authentication from Alma a manual test in staging using the Alma sandbox and it worked much faster.\r\n> \r\n> @kayiwa @acozine a couple of questions?\r\n> \r\n> 1. Alma can give keys as RSA or ECDSA, should we go with the latter?\r\n\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n> 2. Is there a pattern in princeton ansible for managing a public key that we only want to be in the user's authorized_keys files on certain boxes?\r\n\r\nlook at how we use cdh (that can be expanded) [here](https://github.com/pulibrary/princeton_ansible/blob/main/playbooks/pulsys_user.yml)\r\n\r\n> 3. Are there any concerns with having a user utilize password based authentications in certain contexts (i.e. bibdata/lib-jobs using [almasftp@pu.win.princeton.edu](mailto:almasftp@pu.win.princeton.edu) with a password), but also have the same user configured in the external Alma environment to utilize a public key?\r\n\r\nNo there aren't. \r\n"
