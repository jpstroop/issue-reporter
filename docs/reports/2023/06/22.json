This initial batch consists of about 400 collections, many of which are a single box or very few boxes.  Right now the curators are reviewing this list to see if any should be vetoed from going to ReCAP.\r\nFrom talking with Faith, it seems we have 3 options during the process of sending collections to ReCAP vis-à-vis Alma item records -- to do them singly in SC, to provide Regine the information to do them with the manual process, or to use a yet-to-be created automatic process.   The automatic process isn't key to the project, but it could save a lot of time.  However, if this is  a heavy ask and would take a long time it complete, it doesn't seem like it would be worth holding up this ReCAP project.  We may have additional batch (6-10 transactions in the past 10 years for example) depending on the amount of space cleared by this initial batch.\r\nRegine and Will - I hope that gives a bit of context.  Do you have any immediate thoughts or would it be better to have a conversation with all of us and Kevin?"

I wanted to confirm that this ticket was meant to serve as a placeholder until we all met. \r\n\r\nKnowing now that the work to fully automate this process wasn't slated for completion regardless of this project, I think it would be helpful to check in to see whether it should be prioritized for the project or at least for the start of the project especially given how long the work might take/ how much of a lift it will be for your team. My Slack inquiry was about whether it might be possible to resume the work in light of this project thinking that having a fully automated process in place would likely be ideal for all involved.
