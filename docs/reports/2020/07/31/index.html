                <p>@hackmastera that was the approach I took first, and it&#39;s what should happen ultimately, but I decided that, at this point, the code is too grounds-and-buildings specific to codify as a service.  I would like to go ahead and get Grounds and Buildings processed, and then generalize the approach with the next collection like this (Historic Postcards).  @kelea99 , @escowles, and I have been discussing this for a couple of weeks now.</p>

<p>I&#39;m thinking now this isn&#39;t something to include in the Figgy codebase at all; it&#39;s really a private, one-off script.  What do you think?</p>

                <p>I think it&#39;s fine to have specific things in the codebase, and I&#39;d rather have them there so that if something goes weird with the data we can see what was run.</p>

<p>Especially if you hope to generalize it in the future, putting it in the codebase up front is good.</p>

<p>We can always delete things later if we decide they shouldn&#39;t be there, and we have done this.</p>

<p>If there&#39;s a time concern w/r/t/ writing tests to get the materials in I won&#39;t block this PR on that requirement.</p>
