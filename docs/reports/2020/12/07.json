That workflow works because the Access DB stores all records it created.\r\n\r\n```HOW TO DELETE RECORDS:\r\n*If you realize belatedly that you made a mistake after you’ve clicked “Output All” but before you’ve closed the UserAll \r\nform, you can return to the UserAll form and click “Undo today’s output” at the top of the form. The original box numbers, \r\nwhich display in italics following export, will become un-italicized after you’ve undone the output. In order to actually delete \r\nany items, you still need to click “Delete” next to individual rows to delete single items. When you have corrected your \r\nmistakes, you can output again by clicking “Output All.”\r\n*If you realize belatedly that you made a mistake after you’ve closed out of the database entirely, go to the Start form and \r\nclick “Recent Activity.” When prompted to “Enter the number of days to review,” enter a number below 1000 depending on \r\nhow long ago you created the records you want to delete. Once the UserAllRecentActivity form opens, click “Undo output.” \r\nYou should see a list of all items you have created within that time period. Then click the “Delete” button next to each \r\nindividual record you want to delete. When you are finished, click “Output All” to re-do the output of any records in the list \r\nyou do want to keep.\r\nNOTE ABOUT ERRORS: Minor errors in records, i.e. those not relating to barcodes or their associated AbIDs, such as wrong \r\ncollection codes or traditional box numbers, can be corrected in the XML export file rather than deleting and recreating \r\nrecords in the database as the database is not meant to serve as the master record for the data it creates.\r\n```"

(They use MacroExpress to add it to Voyager). That means the current implementation plan doesn't work, since it relies on ASpace to know what the next available number in the sequence is. \r\n\r\nEssentially, to maintain that functionality, we need a freestanding db that both generates and stores the AbIDs (or the last available for each profile, anyway), and then EITHER overwrites the ASpace record OR outputs the AbID's as XML (or sends them to Alma, later).\r\n\r\n(In light of this, I wonder whether it's easier to just keep the current Access db, and just add functionality to import its XML output into ASpace.)"
