That's something I've learned more recently that scholars care about, when looking at images of fragments.

If there's any way to include that information now or add it later, it would be great to have; storing it in Figgy with the digitized fragments seems like the logical/preferred place to me."

However, reviewing the usage metrics for bibdata.princeton.edu, it doesn't really appear as if users are using this on any regular basis.\r\n\r\nMight you or any of your colleagues use this on any regular basis?
