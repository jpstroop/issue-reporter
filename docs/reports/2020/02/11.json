The second issue would be nice to fix, but it would be fine to defer that to a separate issue.\r\n\r\nWhen I look at the HTML source, I see no object_type, etc. filled out even though the saved object has them populated (and displaying in the show view):\r\n```\r\n<input id=\"object_type\" type=\"hidden\" name=\"numismatics_issue[object_type]\" value=\"\" />\r\n```"
