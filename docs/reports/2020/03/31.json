This best practice is based on the assumption that the terminal component represents a retrievable physical item. However, we have exceptions where we have encoded components at the \"sub-item\" level (e.g. prayers in a prayer book, pages of a volume, photographs pasted into an album). These are identified with `c level='otherlevel' otherlevel='text'`.\r\n\r\nI see two issues being brought up here:\r\n1. Requesting currently looks for container information only on the terminal level. That means that requesting for these components is not enabled. (The logic being that you can't request a piece of an integral item, nor can you request something non-physical like text.) To address this, a condition is needed that, when an \"otherlevel\" component is encountered, looks up to the first ancestor that does have container information. (We may need to exclude dao-only (i.e. digital) components in this.)\r\n1. In addition @sdellis is addressing the question of metadata in figgy, which pulls from the EAD component, i.e. does not show container information for \"otherlevel\" components. A similar condition may be needed here."

I'm not saying it's a ton of work, I really don't know, it's just a smaller footprint of required features makes for a quicker release date, and a quicker release date usually results in easier prioritization and recognition of issues."
