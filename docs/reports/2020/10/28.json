I had been assuming that I would run the name job first, load the EADs, and then link them up.  But since we'll have the linking information in the EAD spreadsheet, it actually makes more sense to load the EADs first, and just add the linking process to my name loader.\r\n\r\nSo I think you're right.  Let's plan on removing the names from the EADs.  How should we handle that for the current load though?  We currently have names in the EADs, but we also want to test name loading with at least a sample spreadsheet.```"

This is predicated on the logic that bioghist notes are usually associated with a name (since they make little sense otherwise). \r\n\r\nExempting orphaned biographical notes implies an inverse query that extracts notes that cannot robustly be associated with a name."

I'm having trouble finding components to test with in the subset of data we load.\r\n- One should not be able to add an entire series to the cart, but should instead be able to select from a pick-list of child components.\r\n- The cart detail should not scale in width based on the viewport size. On a mobile device, it should take up the entire screen.\r\n- Somehow the icons look different in the header CartToggle component and the CartDetail and AddToCart components. \r\n- The AddToCart button should be visibly disabled or replaced with \"Item added to cart\" text if the item has already been added to the cart.\r\n- The \"Located In\" field only lists subcontainers, but it should also list the container. I'm also curious how the container gets passed to Aeon as I don't see it when I inspect the form that gets posted to Aeon. When requesting C1588_c4, Folder 2 is listed as both the container and subcontainer in Aeon.\r\n- The title in the CartDetail component should be the full title. It seems to cut off the dates that would distinguish it from other items. (Looking at C1588_c4 for reference.)"
