Francis originally attempted to have Globus share a server with DSpace, but Globus did not play well with DSpace‚Äôs required version of Apache. Also, Globus attempted to integrate DSpace, but they abandoned the project in July 2019. [Press release.](https://www.globus.org/blog/globus-publication-new-approach) [Archived github repo.](https://github.com/globus/globus-publish-dspace)\r\n\r\nWith all that in mind, I ended up recommending to the PRDS team that we not apply any formal integration between DSpace and Globus, at least for now. Instead, I recommended using a Globus link in the metadata.\r\n\r\nHere's a link to the full proposal: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FCr6ADVGenX-Z0SrKhTSZiMKnNmzylyqjry0DSDYdyk/edit#\r\n\r\nLet me know if you have any thoughts about this! I'm not sure how this affects #87  \r\n"

Since we migrated from mysql to postgres the events page had a random order but not in a specific pattern. We relied on the events_controller index action to list all the events by Event.all. In postgres a select will return all the records but in a random order. We fixed this by forcing an ascending order on the events based on the start attribute of the event. The liberate rake tasks when they pull the json from the events page are checking the start attribute. "
