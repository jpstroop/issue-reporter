Move work from https://github.com/pulibrary/alma_experimentation/pull/8/files and  https://github.com/pulibrary/alma_experimentation/pull/33/files into `marc_liberation`.\r\n1. Update the webhook handler. If the webhook action/event indicates an incremental dump job is complete, enqueue the event body to an AWS SQS FIFO queue.\r\n1. Use the sidekiq cron gem https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron to schedule a job to run every 15 minutes as follows: \r\n    1. Is this job is already running? ([example, see option 3](https://blog.francium.tech/avoiding-duplicate-jobs-in-sidekiq-dcbb1aca1e20))\r\n       1. If so, terminate.\r\n       1. If not, check the queue and if there's an event invoke the service that will create the Dump and Event objects, copy the files, and index them.\r\n\r\nThis should ensure that only one incremental job is processed at a time, and that they are processed in order."

Move work from https://github.com/pulibrary/alma_experimentation/pull/8/files and  https://github.com/pulibrary/alma_experimentation/pull/33/files into `marc_liberation`.\r\n1. Update the webhook handler. If the webhook action indicates a full dump job is complete, enqueue the event body to an AWS SQS queue.\r\n1. Use the sidekiq cron gem https://github.com/ondrejbartas/sidekiq-cron to schedule a job to run every 15 minutes as follows:\r\n   1. Check the queue and if there's an event invoke the service that will create the Dump and Event objects and copy the files.\r\n\r\nThis process does not need to do any indexing; full indexing is initiated manually."
