The spacing issues in Approvals are the application css overwriting the non-scoped css, so that should be fixed in the Approvals app. Also, to correct for the removal of `/deep/`, I created a `style` attribute for tag-items so we can apply the pill to the Approvals cards in a PR to that repo. \r\n\r\nUnless I'm missing something, I don't think we can prevent a breaking change when trying to accommodate  the changes required in the functional component work. I will update the semver appropriately when releasing. LMK what you think, and merge if you are 👍 ."
