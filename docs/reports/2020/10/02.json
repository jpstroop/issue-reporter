These are some of our legacy items that we had on the finding aids via webspace as well. I have been told that the only way to remedy is to re-ingest. The issue with a re-ingest is I don't always have the images saved. It has not been a priorty to fix these as you can still access them just not as cleanly as we would like. Anything that is getting ingested now does not have this issue.\"\r\n\r\nUpdate from Alexis regarding these legacy items: We might have others like this and we are going to do a more global review and then I'll reach out.....nd none of this is a super rush, but we're hoping to get it completed by teh end of the year"

In addition to generating the AbID and barcodes, we would need the tool to go into ASpace and plug them in to the Top Container records: replacing traditional box numbers that were entered during processing and adding the barcodes.\r\n\r\nAdditionally I have been struggling with the fact that you can't add container profiles or locations to Top Containers created in ASpace using Rapid Data Entry or the spreadsheet importer. We would likely need to add both of these to every Top Container record, and so I'm wondering if this is something we could add to the tool, since the data is going to the same place in ASpace (Top Container records). \r\n\r\nI could see this working in the tool because a user would be selecting a box size (which is what AbIDs are based on), and additionally they could add the location as well. there could potentially be more than one location added per collection. I'm attaching a spreadsheet of container profiles and locations if that helps to think this through. \r\n[profiles-locations-repos.xlsx](https://github.com/pulibrary/pulfalight/files/5318259/profiles-locations-repos.xlsx)\r\n\r\n"
