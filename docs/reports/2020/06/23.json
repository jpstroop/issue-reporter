Maybe someone else could read the documentation and confirm this interpretation. If this is the case, though, it's a pretty big ask. We'd need to create a mapping from every possible lcsh genre value that might be in figgy? Plus whatever is used in pulfa since we have both finding aid and bibdata materials. This \"type\" information is not pulled from finding aid objects.\n\n\nThen in addition they want a narrower term but one from their list.\n\nFor example https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/293290cc-ee72-4ce5-ab49-61a303d77776 has type \"Pictorial works\" but that is not on their list.\n\nShould we send what we have anyway for this second narrower term?
