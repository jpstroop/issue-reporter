This was changed by ADAPT fairly recently. \r\n\r\nIn ASpace, both \"review\" and \"closed\" will be set to \"restrictions=>true\" in ASpace (\"open\" will correspondingly be \"restrictions=>false\"), with the text of the restriction stored in \"notes\". On the top_container record, the default value for the type of restriction will most likely be a generic \"Restricted\"--we're still in the process of working that out with Lyrasis--and the text of the note I believe will be in \"active_restrictions\"."
