Like should there be an ARK that goes to the download link? Maybe not important for this.\r\n\r\n2. Maybe not important, but the example ZIP is pretty nuts - it's like 8 levels of folders deep which seems to replicate the hydra_sources directory structure. Maybe something to fix on that example record?\r\n\r\n3. An empty broken viewer is going to show up in PULFA as soon as this record is marked complete, and I'm not sure adding a download link will fix it. We'll have to test it.\r\n\r\nAnyways, as a first step it seems like to close this ticket I'll just make it put the download link in for ZIPs, but some thoughts about future potential issues above."

I haven't heard any desire for ARKs linking to the downloads as opposed to the finding aid or other landing page.\r\n\r\n2. I agree the deep folder structure of that object isn't great, and reflects a lot of the Figgy server setup and the bagging structure of the content. @cwulfman should probably checkin with Annalise and make sure the Zip files in Figgy have the structure we want to preserve, and not anything extra.\r\n\r\n3. It would be great to prevent an empty viewer showing up. Either making the viewer iframe show the download link, or suppressing the display of the viewer completely if it's not going to work, would be much better. "
