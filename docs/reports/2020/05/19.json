No, we would not want multiple objects representing the same data if we can help it.\r\n2. I personally see no downside to this other than the potential adventures with syncing to DPUL.\r\n3. I believe the coins and medals the studio shot were ingested as title only, but I will confirm that now. all other metadata for the coins was added in DPUL for the exhibits.\r\nI agree with your one representative object in our repository."
