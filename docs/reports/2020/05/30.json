So it would only be the header of that one fiche that needs to be refilmed.\r\n\r\nI checked the other title that Tortebat title belongs to and they have very similar dcl numbers (dcl:rbv and dcl:rvb) so there might have been a switcheroo because of that (also I wouldn't know how that is possible?) but the Tortebat in itself looks fine and does not contain the missing header. Alas, that would have been to easy.\r\n\r\n[unrelated to original issue: the Tortebat has a weird image at the end that might be a faulty scan: https://figgy.princeton.edu/catalog/83fd93b2-1cf6-4458-9fc4-e566f2260cb4]\r\n\r\n"

Just something that helps a user navigate and identify what they are looking for and that is not just the same title for all. In other examples it would be a volume designator or for if the titles vary much like in the Trattato and accompanying Disegno example we had here yesterday. Does that make sense? I am not fixed on any particular solution here, just something that makes one more aware what might hide between the different structmap sections.\r\n\r\ncheers!"
