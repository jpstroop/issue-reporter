From the fields returned it doesn't look like there's anything that can help us here. I've asked for more details but unfortunately it looks like we're in a situation similar to OpenNeuro: unless we have a step where someone inputs a record id we won't be able to pull metadata from this repository. Even then it might not be entirely reliable, since there doesn't seem to be a way to limit the query to a specific field. The grant number would probably be the most reliable identifier, since their record id is just an integer.\n\nHere's the info I received (there was a problem with the api via the swagger ui, which he refers to at the end):\n\n```\nYou could try a request using cURL for example:\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://nda.nih.gov/api/search/nda_sw_removal/collection/full' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \\\n--data-raw 'Princeton'\nThis returns no search results, as organization is not one of the attributes we currently expose for search from within the search API. \n\nWe do, however, support query by grant number, which will return the collection associated with this grant.\ncurl --location --request POST 'https://nda.nih.gov/api/search/nda_sw_removal/collection/full' \\\n--header 'Content-Type: text/plain' \\\n--data-raw 'R01MH112566'\n\nHere is the result from this web service request:\n{\n \"study\": {\n \"total\": 0,\n \"results\": []\n    },\n \"experiment\": {\n \"total\": 0,\n \"results\": []\n    },\n \"concept\": {\n \"total\": 0,\n \"results\": []\n    },\n \"publication\": {\n \"total\": 0,\n \"results\": []\n    },\n \"datastructure\": {\n \"total\": 0,\n \"results\": []\n    },\n \"datadict\": {\n \"total\": 0,\n \"results\": []\n    },\n \"collection\": {\n \"total\": 1,\n \"results\": [\n            {\n \"pi_list\": \"Uri Hasson\",\n \"phase\": \"Enrolling\",\n \"overview\": \"Social interaction in real-life contexts necessitates dynamical interactions among two or more brains as individuals listen, speak, act, and mutually adapt to one another to reach shared understanding. Elucidating how brains forge such shared understanding requires shifting from a one-brain to a multiple-brain frame of reference, as well as from artificial laboratory conditions to natural, real-life settings. Here we outline a novel framework to identify inter-brain dynamical coupling that underpins knowledge about social phenomena e.g.,mental states, social norms, emotions, etc., henceforth referred to as social knowledge. The long-term goal of our laboratories is to understand how neural networks couple, within and across brains, to create and share information that enables social understanding and connectedness. We intend to develop a novel brain-to-brain coupling framework to better understand how social concepts are represented in the brain and how they are transferred across brains to achieve group cohesiveness. The overall objective of this application is to identify mechanisms that facilitate coupling across a speaker and a listener during real life interaction. This approach is innovative because it uses new experimental paradigms optimize for studying social interactions in naturalistic contexts, employs both fMRI and fNIRS methods single scanning and hyperscanning, and includes development of novel analysis methods for modeling shared brain responses to complex, natural social stimuli in real-life contexts. This contribution is significant because the proposed research will provide new insights into a central function of the human brain the ability to connect with others by dynamically and interactively creating and sharing social knowledge. The work proposed in this application will advance knowledge of how brains process and share information in ways that promote social understanding and will produce new approaches for detecting and diagnosing communication and developmental disorders.\",\n \"id\": \"2611\",\n \"_score\": 6.417647,\n \"title\": \"Brain-to-brain dynamical Coupling: A New framework for the communication of social knowledge\",\n \"grantNumber\": \"R01MH112566\"\n            }\n        ]\n    },\n \"content\": {\n \"total\": 0,\n \"results\": []\n    }\n}\n\nI have tagged this ticket as a user story for our search API, for future consideration, and we will correct the swagger configuration.\n```"

          "body": "Regarding the error I was getting from the swagger UI, here's the relevant Q/A (for posterity):\n\n---\nHello,\n\nWe’re starting a project to harvest metadata about datasets from Princeton University researchers from different data repositories.\n\nI’m looking at your API documentation and I hope you can help me with some questions.\n\nFirst, is the search API the best way to harvest metadata? I.e. do you offer any other harvesting services or endpoints such as OAI-PMH?\n\nSecond, the documentation [1] states that the search api does not require authentication. But when I try it out on the swagger ui [2] it returns a 401 Unauthorized code [3]. Do I actually need authentication or is there a bug with the swagger ui?\n\nFinally, in the UI when I go to “Get Data” > “Data from Labs” I can select “Princeton University” in the “Organization” field to get the results I’m interested in. How can I replicate that search with the API? I’m not sure what querystring parameters to use since they don’t appear in my url when I submit the form.\n\nThanks so much for your help,\nAnna\n\n[1] https://nda.nih.gov/tools/apis.html\n[2] https://nda.nih.gov/api/search/docs/swagger-ui.html#!/search/searchUsingPOST_1\n[3]\n```\n {\n\"timestamp\": 1589995033017,\n\"status\": 401,\n\"error\": \"Unauthorized\",\n\"message\": \"Full authentication is required to access this resource\",\n\"path\": \"/api/search/api/search/nda/%7Btypes%7D/full\"\n}\n```\n\n---\nHello Anna,\n\nThere is an error in the swagger user interface configuration, it currently has a property set for base url of \n[ base url: /api/search/api/search ]\n\nThe API does have protected non-public endpoints, and the configuration requires authentication for any requests that aren't for public-facing endpoints whether they are exist or not. That is reason you are getting the 401 unauthorized response.\n\n...(the rest of the response is in the comment above)"
