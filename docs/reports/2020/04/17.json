Ellen (SAE subject Selector) and I talked a lot about boxes versus collections and it was decided the virtual boxes with dummy barcodes would be the best way forward. I share our rationale here, as well as the proposed workflow. If there is any downside and it would, indeed, be preferable to not use boxes, please let me know! :) \r\n\r\n- **Decision:** create dummy boxes (use \"00000000000000\" for the barcodes, since they will be required) — those boxes won't show up in dpul, but can be used in figgy to segment the items for management\r\n\r\n- **Rationale:** Creation of dummy boxes versus adding collections would simplify ingest, and diminish potential for human error when adding to/deciding on collections in the future.\r\n\r\n- **Workflow:** https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-k8jQuP8DbUVFjQZ0srz2PSA2EJ7rI4sqwn52IwpNYs/edit"
