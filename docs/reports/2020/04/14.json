It seems that the \"Download EAC-CPF\" option for agent records isn't exporting all of the metadata, specifically data found in the Notes subrecord. Please see the person record for Margaret Snyder in the Public Policy Papers repo: https://aspace-staff.princeton.edu/agents/agent_person/232 as an example. The exported xml record is missing the Biography/Historical note. Not sure what's going on here-whether it's something with our instance or a bug in the system. This is occurring in dev and prod.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm not sure why two blank Assessment records are displaying as part of this record. Assessment records, which we haven't started using yet, are normally only associated with accession and resource records. Not sure whether this is another bug.\r\n\r\nThanks for your help, @jrgriffiniii. "

The policy has been that only retrievable physical items can be requestable. @sdellis I worry that what you're suggesting would make non-physical items requestable in the finding aid. That would create a different problem for Public Services, since they're not in fact retrievable, so we'd have to address that issue in the request bundling anyway (we'd have to treat them like folders in a box or something like that). \r\n\r\nIf we're going to have to add a scenario anyway, I think it'd be much better to leave the container information on the physical item and add the scenario of non-retrievable othertypes to the code, not change the data to shoehorn it into existing code.
