Then people can request a page in a volume the same way they request a folder in a box. Would this be an acceptable solution?"

Automated would be easiest, could be most recent, or randomly generated from what we have. How would thumbnails be automated? Curation would require more work on the part of SC staff, but could result in more compelling content that the dept wants to showcase. Need to have this conversation with AnnaLee, Squirrel, and others who may be responsible for this work.\n\nAdvanced Search feature?\nWill basic search support boolean searching of multiple topics and phrases? Does the current approach of facet refinement support these boolean style features? This is a good topic for User Research. We should come up with \"advanced search tasks\" and see if facet refinement is enough for people or if they struggle. \n\nNo one uses Locations. We want to retain Topics and Names as a feature, although they are outdated and ADAPT needs to revisit and revise. Are people actually using these features or not? Action item: Shaun will get some numbers on these. Need a way to \"Browse Collections\" that does not involve a blank search.\n\n\n\n"

As a first thought I would say that checking if the location is 'mud' is enough to decide for the request. \r\n~But there is a dspace:true or dspace:false in the holdings_1display key \"thesis\" which seems to change the availability.\r\nBased on this example https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/dsp01k0698b34p we should check the key thesis and the dspace value and if it is false (which means that it's embargoed), then we should not display the 'Reading room Request' button. Is this correct? This is the holdings_1display field: `\"holdings_1display\":\"{\\\"thesis\\\":{\\\"location\\\":\\\"Mudd Manuscript Library\\\",\\\"library\\\":\\\"Mudd Manuscript Library\\\",\\\"location_code\\\":\\\"mudd\\\",\\\"call_number\\\":\\\"AC102\\\",\\\"call_number_browse\\\":\\\"AC102\\\",\\\"dspace\\\":false}}\"`~ I opened an issue for this last part in Orangelight."
