As a first answer I would say that checking location mud is enough to decide for the request. \r\nBut there is a dspace:true or dspace:false in the holdings_1display key \"thesis\" which seems to change the availability.\r\nBased on this example https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/dsp01k0698b34p we should check the key thesis and the dspace value and if it is false (which means that it's embargoed), then we should not display the 'Reading room Request' button. Is this correct? This is the holdings_1display field: `\"holdings_1display\":\"{\\\"thesis\\\":{\\\"location\\\":\\\"Mudd Manuscript Library\\\",\\\"library\\\":\\\"Mudd Manuscript Library\\\",\\\"location_code\\\":\\\"mudd\\\",\\\"call_number\\\":\\\"AC102\\\",\\\"call_number_browse\\\":\\\"AC102\\\",\\\"dspace\\\":false}}\"`"
