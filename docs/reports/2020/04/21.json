The reason I thought Biography/History should be the only note available is because I referenced the user manual: https://archivesspace.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/ArchivesSpaceUserManual/pages/894533774/Agent+Record+Fields, specially the section about the Notes sub-record that reads: \"Note Type (dropdown list): Note types are used to guide the export of note contents to certain elements in specific data formats. The only available value is Biographical / Historical for all agent types.\" Perhaps this documentation is out of date?\r\n\r\nAlso, not sure if you saw my comment above about whether the inability to export this note when selecting the \"Download EAC-CPF\" option seems to be an issue with the code base, or is it perhaps something wonky going on with our instance?\r\n\r\nThanks!"
