I am working on the Series View (the sortable table) now, but I'd like to get your feedback sooner than later.\r\n\r\n**Collection Summary**\r\nHere's what's different and why:\r\n1. The DACS-level sections are no longer bundled into the tree navigation. Instead they form a sub-nav at the collection level. Whenever the user is looking at any series or components, the \"Contents\" tab is active. If the user clicks the Contents tab, they will get a Series view at the top level (wireframe is forthcoming).\r\n2. I moved the \"action items\" to the bottom of the screen. These will not scroll, but will be like a persistent footer for the components. This is because it's a common pattern on mobile apps/devices to have action items near the bottom to make it easier on the thumbs. :)\r\n\r\nHere are my outstanding questions:\r\n1. \"List View\" is what I'm calling SPV. You can access it from the top of the tree, from any page in the collection. Is this an appropriate name and location?2. Topics, Names, and Collections. Do we really want to keep them in the main header? That is where the most important site-wide info goes and given that we know we have work to do on Topics and Names, should they still be so prominent?\r\n3. What do you think about the Contents tab and showing the top level \"Series View\"?\r\n<img width=\"1011\" alt=\"CollectionSummary\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/609368/80025294-644a7a80-84ae-11ea-98b5-530a5bca4788.png\">\r\n\r\n**Component Detail**\r\nHere's what's different and why:\r\n1. I moved the \"action items\" to the bottom of the screen. These will not scroll, but will be like a persistent footer for the components.\r\n2. The tree view is based on the Mmenu layout and colors. We can tweak the colors (or remove them), but there are two things I want to point out. First, the \"active\" node on the tree will be the same background as the content and will tie in from the left. Second, if this node has children, the arrow will be on the right but will also be the active color. \r\n\r\nHere are my outstanding questions:\r\nGeneral thoughts?\r\n\r\n<img width=\"1013\" alt=\"ComponentDetail\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/609368/80025307-69a7c500-84ae-11ea-99c5-e3340719a81c.png\">\r\n"

You can access it from the top of the tree, from any page in the collection. Is this an appropriate name and location? **I think that's an appropriate location, especially since the goal is to eventually do away with this when functionality exists that makes this version obsolete. I don't think the terminology is intuitive. My suggestion would be \"HTML view.\" We don't want to confuse users into thinking that this other view will provide more or different information than they can find in the \"tree view,\" which is the issue on the current site.**\r\n\r\nTopics, Names, and Collections. Do we really want to keep them in the main header? That is where the most important site-wide info goes and given that we know we have work to do on Topics and Names, should they still be so prominent? **I'm not seeing these in this particular wireframe, but I remember being ok with them being in main header since they didn't seem particularly visible due to the font size.**\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the Contents tab and showing the top level \"Series View\"? **I don't know if it's just the color schema, but it seems perhaps a bit too prominent on the page. I'm also not a fan of showing the top-level series view since the order of series doesn't typically have any significance. I think it should just display all of the parent components in a flat list, per the current site.**\r\n\r\n**Component Detail**\r\nHere's what's different and why:\r\nI moved the \"action items\" to the bottom of the screen. These will not scroll, but will be like a persistent footer for the components. **I _think_ I'm ok with the request button being on the bottom as opposed to the top of the screen? (Also, will the label say \"Request [xx] as it does on the current site?)**\r\n\r\nThe tree view is based on the Mmenu layout and colors. We can tweak the colors (or remove them), but there are two things I want to point out. First, the \"active\" node on the tree will be the same background as the content and will tie in from the left. Second, if this node has children, the arrow will be on the right but will also be the active color. **Per my comment above regarding the Contents tab I feel like perhaps the colors or the boldness or some such is perhaps too prominent.** \r\n\r\nHere are my outstanding questions:\r\nGeneral thoughts? **I like it overall.
