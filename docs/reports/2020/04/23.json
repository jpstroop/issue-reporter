We know we don't like \"Entire Finding Aid\".\r\n\r\n_Do we need to provide downloadable PDFs?_\r\nIt would be much easier to allow people to print the SPV (with print CSS) vs. generating PDFs.\r\n\r\n_The Table of Contents feels \"heavy\" in the wireframes. Can we make the proportions more similar to the current site?_\r\nWe have some constraints when it comes to developing for both mobile and accessibility. We need to make it easy for users to select either A) the component label or B) the expand/collapse icon. We also need to increase both  font and the spacing of the table. Here is the acceptance criteria we need to meet WCAG 2.1:\r\n\r\n1. Target Size: [To be considered \"Operable\" the click target needs to be at least 44x44 pixels](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=144%2C1412#target-size). This is what [44x44 pixels](https://dummyimage.com/44x44/ffffff/000000.gif) looks like. This is a WCAG AAA requirement. We aim for AA compliance, so we don't legally have to comply, but it's what is recommended.\r\n2. Legibility: WCAG has no Text Size requirement, but [requires that a user needs to be able to resize/scale text up to 200 times without losing any functionality or content to be \"Perceptible\"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/?showtechniques=144%2C1412#resize-text). This will be interesting to see how things wrap and how the hierarchy is represented at these sizes. The common browser default is a font size of 16px. We can go smaller than that, but I would definitely bump up our current TOC item size which is 11px. \r\n\r\nOne thing I can do is look at playing with the color/grayscale values since the \"heaviness\" seems to come from the deeper nested items being darker and higher contrast. Something like this might be more fitting:\r\n<img width=\"445\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2020-04-23 at 1 06 16 PM\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/609368/80128215-586cc000-8563-11ea-8e8f-5abbdeaed986.png\">\r\n"
