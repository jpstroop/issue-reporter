          "body": "@mzelesky question to alma:\r\n\r\nMy team has noticed that some MARC records included in the general publishing job we ran from Alma have invalid structure. I will use the following MMS ID as an example: 991364420000541\r\n\r\nThe version in our general publishing job (set to output as MARC21 binary) has a Unicode character in position 18 of the leader made up of the following three bytes: \\xEF\\xBF\\xBD (the Unicode replacement character U+FFFD). As a result, the directory structure is invalid, due to the Leader being 2 bytes longer than it should be. When retrieving the bib in MARCXML via the Bib API, the Unicode replacement character is still in the leader, but because MARCXML doesn't have positionally-defined data, it doesn't corrupt the rest of the record.\r\n\r\nThis was not a widespread issue; there were fewer than 10 records in the entire sandbox. But I wanted to bring it to your attention. It seems that records are not served in MARC21 binary 100% accurately. As a workaround, we can use the MARCXML standard for our publishing jobs. It is a larger format that is somewhat slower to process, but it should suffice."
