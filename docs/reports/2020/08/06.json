I guess it's time for me to submit a PR.\r\n\r\nI'll double-check later today, but I don't think that @unit works in extent statements.\r\n\r\nAlso, item(s) should work in extents. Could you send me a example where they are failing?\r\n\r\nSome other issues:\r\n\r\nFor extents, the importer looks for \"whole\" or \"part\" in @altrender instead of @type.\r\nEmpty note fields (or `<head>` only notes) cause the import to fail.\r\nEmpty subelements in `<controlaccess>` cause the import to fail.\r\nIn addition to end dates before beginnings, other invalid @normal dates.\r\nMissing `<unitdate>` at the resource level\r\nMissing `<unitid>` at the resource level\r\nAlso, I don't know if you've seen Dave Mayo and Kate Bowers' article:  https://journal.code4lib.org/articles/12239  Some of the things that they mention have been fixed. (I've been planning on going through and making a list of the current status of everything, but haven't had time.) Even so, it's still a great guide.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nBrian\r\n"

When we first added the patron_group_charged attribute we didn't pull it all the way to the full_mfhd_availability because the need was only to retrieve it in the EligibleItemService using https://bibdata.princeton.edu/bibliographic/7214786/items. Also @mzelesky explained that the https://github.com/pulibrary/voyager_helpers/blob/839acb7db247150fded107989a14680a0cc4d8ce/lib/voyager_helpers/liberator.rb#L214 is used on the search results page not on the record page. Thank you @mzelesky for your valuable input!"
