Sync the MVWs over to DPUL and deal with them at that level (and use ordering and structure for description within the MVWs)\r\n2. Add some logic to figure out that we want to sync the members of these MVWs (not sure if there's a way to identify those now, or if we'd add a new property, or something else)\r\n3. Revisit the modeling and consider making these collections instead of MVWs (which would solve the DPUL problem, but bring back the problem from #3815) — we have several cases of photo albums and photograph collections with similar issues, so being able to do this would help more than just this collection\r\n4.

Ok, so:\r\n1. we could, but is order/structure really appropriate for yet more description if we are using it already as a discovery tool for each item in the MVW? I dont see it as ideal or working with every use case. I may be wrong.\r\n2. Can we talk a bit more about this possibility?\r\n3. If it helps: as a work around, we were able to get around the photograph collections  in Western Americana by treating the photo album itself as an individual work with a MARC record. all the individual photographs are still FA items. \r\n4. This seems the more reasonable way forward, since this is a big reason why we are revisiting problems with ingest and metadata for more than one collection at this point. "
