I think what we were worried about is we just don't schedule these meetings with other teams' schedules in mind, so we worry that we're blocking commitments. Or I do, at least."

I wasn't really wanting to do this, for fear of losing local work that I'd stashed or accidentally losing a branch I had wip on. So I ran it in a different location.\r\n\r\nSteps:\r\n\r\n- Clone Esmé's script to some location, cd there, make it executable\r\n- Run the script\r\n- Change the base/target of all open PRs. They won't close automatically but merging them will merge them to master, not to main.\r\n- Transfer branch protection policies\r\n- All devs will need to update local settings\r\n  - run `git fetch`\r\n  - Delete local 'master' branch: `git branch -d master`\r\n  - Not sure what others will encounter, but as a user of the `hub` command line tool I had to run this to ensure my PRs will issue to the correct target base: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main`"

Run the tool\r\n2. Create a PR updating the default branch in `deploy.rb`\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow-up required for with my local clone was:\r\n\r\n- Run `git fetch`\r\n- `git checkout main`\r\n- Delete local 'master' branch: `git branch -d master`\r\n- Not sure what others will encounter, but as a user of the hub command line tool I had to run this to ensure my PRs will issue to the correct target base: `git symbolic-ref refs/remotes/origin/HEAD refs/remotes/origin/main`"
