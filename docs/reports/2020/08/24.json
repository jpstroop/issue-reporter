This issue essentially means that the feature to detach and attach resources from parent resources (originally requested by the Cicognara project) does not work. We were wondering if you have received any questions about it, or if folks just aren't really trying to use that feature right now. It has been affecting @tventimi occasionally, but so far we've been able to handle these problems as they've come up. Do you think we should look to prioritize this issue soon? If yes, @kelynch suggested that maybe we could put it in the work cycle starting september 7th, which will have a focus on virtual reading room requirements. Thanks!"
