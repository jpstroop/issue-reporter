But then, at some point if we load more files we'll have more rows with the same oclc number. At that point we would need to make the bibid a more complex object as opposed to just being an id, since it would need to have the source as part of that object.\r\n\r\nImpact on https://github.com/pulibrary/marc_liberation/issues/758 is that it would return multi-item arrays."
