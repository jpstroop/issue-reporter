We also changed the first heading, which I think will look better with left alignment, but I will take your good advice if you feel strongly about it remaining centered. Here is the document with new text: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gfACi4KcKjdfE_GI59ZWcLQ1s0Y3h2Al/edit\r\n \r\nFor the Become a Contributor page, I have added the new Contributing Partner requirements to the first paragraph and  moved the Getty Research Portal logo and information under the current text. See page edits needed here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1XZMU7kOPbm6NBkeFCey3IEc_SOXvSZowqWL0xWcCGx4/edit\r\n \r\nFor the Digital Cicognara Library / Contributor FAQs Page: See added sentence in RED on question two regarding the Contributing partner commitment requirements.\r\n \r\nFor the PARTNERS page: See desired changes here: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gJTySs2Ew8biWXfttzQlJWigYM9rnFFy/edit\r\n\r\nI think this is clearer and more simplified. I think the contributing partners on the doc should all be listed, despite all not having giving surrogates yet. We can always remove them later if they decide not to participate. I hope all the logos will be possible, if not, list contributing partners without logos for now."
