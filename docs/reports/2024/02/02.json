It may in fact be beneficial to still have this sub-community called ITER and Tokamaks after reviewing its contents. Rather, I think PPPL will prefer to have a new \"Tokamak Experimental Sciences\". That's because TES has multiple areas of work, including NSTX-U under the new reorganization. ITER is another area and it's anticipated to grow so having work distinguished as ITER may in fact be fruitful.\r\n\r\nI'll close out this issue in the mean time."
