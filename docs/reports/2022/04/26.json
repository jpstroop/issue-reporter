Is the idea that it's just an API endpoint that waits for some system to send it an ID to then update?\r\n\r\nI'm also a bit wary of GraphQL pubsub as I feel like we may have instances where we will want to sync systems in which GraphQL is not involved. It also seems a bit underdeveloped based on the docs.\r\n\r\nI assume each of these solutions will also require some plugin/code to be written for ASpace that \"publishes\" data updates (or in the case of #1, makes an API request), correct?"
