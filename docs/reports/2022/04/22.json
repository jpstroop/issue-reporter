There are two hyperlinks under \"Available online\" that navigate to the page one is already on, but slightly lower down the page so you can see a bit of the viewer peeking up to say \"hi\".  We should probably look into why there are two links to the same content and remove one of those links.\r\n2. Clicking on the links does not navigate one to the viewer, front and center. \r\n\r\n### Expected behaviour\r\nWhen I click on a link below \"available online\", I expect that link to either take me to the viewer or navigate to where the viewer is on the page, making it the focal point of the screen.\r\n\r\n### Actual behaviour\r\nWhen I click on a link below \"available online\", the link navigates to the same page, and only partially brings the viewer into the screen view at the bottom of the page.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce behaviour\r\nGo to: https://catalog.princeton.edu/catalog/10656589\r\nClick on either \r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nView before clicking on a  \"available online\" hyperlink:\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-04-22 at 5 40 18 PM (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45043014/164800270-862ea7a7-98de-4436-9af4-93ca34549567.png)\r\n\r\nView after clicking on a \"available online\" hyperlink:\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-04-22 at 5 40 27 PM (2)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/45043014/164800390-09080c16-ef56-44f7-872d-1cb9ec87abe8.png)\r\n"
