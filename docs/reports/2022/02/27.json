          "body": "@tpendragon and @eliotjordan the unpublished Lapidus-pamphlets DPUL site is not going to be used. Everything has been added to the live Lapidus dpul site that is functional: https://dpul.princeton.edu/lapidus.  However, navigating to the \"Lapidus pamplets\" collection within that live site via the link within the metadata returns the same error as the DPUL collection (for obvious reasons).  For the time being, I will not make the collection link visible in the metadata and the search facet for collections is not visible. \r\n**Proposal:**\r\n-  Now: Delete the unpublished dpul site for lapidus_pamphlets and if we have to rebuild, we will do so later. \r\n-  Before 31 May, 2022: Research why the collection link is broken so that we can have it back up and running by June.  The Collection within the already published DPUL site is to be completed in DPUL in June, 2022.\r\n- Troubleshoot: I can always create a new collection tag in Figgy, batch tag the lapidus pamphlets collection items to it, and delete the \"Lapidus Pamphlets\" collection."
