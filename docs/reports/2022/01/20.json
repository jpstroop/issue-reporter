The only issue that I believe could cause confusion to users is that *sometimes* we render the \"related names\" as links and sometimes as text (i.e. not links.)\r\n\r\nAs indicated in the PR we render them as text (i.e. not links) when the values are not indexed in Solr, but this might be confusing to users. Yet, I could not come up with a better approach.\r\n\r\nWe could always render them as text (never as links) if we wanted to prevent confusion but then we lose some functionality since sometimes the data in the Book is just as good as the data in the Version record.\r\n\r\nAnother approach would be to index the data in the Version records but that would make this much more complicate problem."

I do think it would be somewhat strange to have items sometimes be links and sometimes not.\r\n\r\nI like the idea of indexing the values from the Version records, since that would let us make them always be links, and would probably improve searching functionality in general. But I'm not sure what the complexity (and performance) impact of that would be. Is the indexer already loading those records, or would indexing these fields require a lot more data loading/parsing/etc.?"

If you put that in Figgy it works fine.\n\nIn fact, if you use the \"-\" version (which is only in the pulfalight URL) in Figgy then I think DAO updating wouldn't work, since it'd try to find the archival object and not find it (there's no \"AC107-07_c897\"). \n\nSo I think there's a few things to do here:\n\n- [x] Update all instances of \"-\" in Figgy with \".\" (this should only be new records I think?)\n- [x] Update the Pulfalight javascript that looks up the viewer to use periods instead of dashes.\n- [ ] If a user enters a \"-\" and it finds a record whose actual call number is \".\" it should use that as the source metadata identifier."
