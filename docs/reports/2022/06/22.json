I thought perhaps knowing how the old workflow was implemented might influence the new workflow. I see that Esme had noted that Mark was most involved in the former process. \r\n\r\nThe output should be the same as the collection-level records that are being generated: each component includes a creator and subject headings; many also have scopecontent, and the collection-level access note should display unless there's a component-level note that supersedes it (though, I don't think there are any component-level access notes). I can work with ADAPT folks to create a mapping though if that would be helpful. "
