That said it should have no impact.  We intended for removed staff to be utilized to disable users from the web page, but we realized that folks get added and removed from the PeopleSoft report for reasons other than termination.  For example when a person changes organization structure they can be removed from the file for a few days.  This happened to Wind C. during our testing phase."
