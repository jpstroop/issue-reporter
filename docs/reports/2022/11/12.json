This documentation exists purely for historical reasons\r\n> > Mediaflux uses Direct Internet Message Encapsulation (DIME) encoding for all messages. Knowing about DIME is only relevant if any of the following applies:\r\n> > • You are using web-services, in which case DIME encoding must be specified when setting up the web-service client application.\r\n> > • You need to write a native client in a language other than Java (and cannot use web-services).\r\n> \r\n> Further down:\r\n> \r\n> > The native format is used for TCP/IP transport. Native Mediaflux messages are DIME encoded. The first record in the DIME message contains a Mediaflux service request or response, described below. The subsequent DIME records contain attachments, if any.\r\n> \r\n> Reading https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Internet_Message_Encapsulation\r\n> \r\n> > … the limit being the size information for each chunk, which was 32 bits so 1 gigabit …\r\n> \r\n> (ie, the zero bytes are there because the file length was less than 2^16… if it were longer, there would be fewer zeros.) \r\n> \r\n> So there seem to be mixed messages here: It’s deprecated… but it’s used for encoding all messages?\r\n> \r\n> … and there is a Ruby library for it: https://formats.kaitai.io/dime_message/ruby.html\r\n> \r\n> (But maybe we shouldn’t go too deep here? My sense is that we’re probably not going to be supporting upload through the app … just moving around files that are already on disk? But it will still probably come in handy… :shrug: )"
