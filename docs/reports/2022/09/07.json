The correct format would be 6xx _4 with no $2 for an uncontrolled heading: https://www.loc.gov/marc/bibliographic/bd600.html\r\nHowever, 6xx _4 doesn't show up in Blacklight, so we would really want to change them all to 6xx _0 even though some of the names are not valid LCSH\r\nWe don't want to add 6xx _4 because there are a lot of other libraries' local vocabularies in various records that are coded that way.\r\n**We do want to retain the $0 for the viaf headings.**"
