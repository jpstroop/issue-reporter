Should both be set on each box?\r\n- On a related note, I've used that test.rb script in the past as a quick check to make sure that authentication is working correctly -- but it's set to use `aspace_staging_login`.  Could we change it to `aspace_login` so it could test authenticating against either environment?  Or is there a better way to check authentication?"

I don't like having that weird collection ID input - to get away from that you'd have to commit to some sort of naming convention for the bags that include the collection EAD ID (we need to be able to get the EAD to map the barcodes to component IDs)\r\nOption 2: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1pg9ns9rVPgjiQ9bUsP1Hng4blZJFFMWuFI6lPHpeVnk/edit This is the closest to what you're doing right now. I'm not sure it'll work for your use cases, since it'd inherit all the visibility from the parent collection to the resulting items.\r\nOption 3: https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1zSY5NMi1a5jojIqBi0nZs9Dkol0xB8Ls7Dnx9aKZByo/edit This is a middle ground, where you still explicitly pick the collection to ingest into, which then acts as the choice that option 1's input box had.
