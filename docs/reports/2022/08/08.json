In addition to differences between the schema, some liberties were taken with applying Dublin Core and there are some changes in how we want to optimally describe assets moving forward.  \r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThe following table shows Dublin Core from the record in this ticket and the complementary Datacite property. The Datacite property will link to the part of the schema 4.4 help document that discusses the specific property. \r\n\r\n*Some Dublin Core will not map neatly to Datacite. I have noted properties that I'm seeking further input on. I will update the table and notify RDSS when I have gathered more complete information.*\r\n\r\n|   Dublin Core   |   Datacite   | Notes |\r\n| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |\r\n| Title | [Title](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties#3-title) | |\r\n| Contributors | [Creator](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties#2-creator) | In the context of this example, the \"contributors\" are \"creators\" of the work. Note that an additional field for \"[contributor](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#7-contributor)\" in Datacite regards non-authoring contributors of the deposit. |\r\n| Issue Date | [PublicationYear](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties#5-publicationyear) | This is the year the object was published to the repository. Hector has made this automatic for the Describe Form. |\r\n| Related Publication | placeholder | HH looking into nuance of this. |\r\n| Abstract | [Description](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#17-description), with sub-property [descriptionType](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#17a-descriptiontype); suggest \"abstract\" from controlled list for sub-property |  This will be something to discuss further, because \"abstract\" is too suggestive of the associated paper's abstract for a depositor to always understand what we are asking for, which is a unique description of the deposited data, code or other object. For the new form and metadata, we want to encourage \"Description\" to capture this information, but may want to optionally allow a choice of description types, if someone wants to get more specific. Please reach out if you want to talk about this. |\r\n| Description | [Description](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#17-description), with sub-property [descriptionType](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#17a-descriptiontype); suggest \"other\" from controlled list for sub-property | The blurb entered to this field is fine for a supplementary description, though it wouldn't stand as a good description on it's own. If this record didn't also contain the \"abstract\" then a summary description should be taken from the README (if the submitter is unavailable), because we need a good description that will include searchable terms to be indexed by search engines. Additionally, an end-user shouldn't have to access the README to understand if this deposit is what they are looking for. |\r\n| URI | <ul><li>For a DOI minted with Datacite: [Identifier](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties#1-identifier) </li><li>For an ARK: [AlternateIdentifier with mandatory sub-property](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#11-alternateidentifier) | Some legacy records may only have an ARK, but new records (and some legacy) will have the DOI minted via Datacite that should be used with Identifier. |\r\n| Appears in Collections | placeholder | To be discussed further with Wind who has concerns about continuing to organize our records in this manner. It may still be useful categorization, but we might not make this as prominent as before. |"
