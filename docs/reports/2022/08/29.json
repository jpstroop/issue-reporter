Not sure if you'll want to create another ticket to differentiate, but re: box labels, labels for oversize folders are not being created. I can check in with ADAPT folks to see if this is actually an issue since staff have been creating these labels manually due to the fact that we're including information in Locations Note field, for example, \"B-South 7, Drawer 5.\" Unless there's a way to add this info programmatically for top containers that are folders? A finding aid that has a couple of (oversize) folders as top containers is C0511.\r\n\r\nRe: folder labels, in cases where a component/archival object has an oversize folder or DO instance _in addition_ to a box instance, folder labels say \"Multiple Items\" and display the title twice in small font. See for example the folder labels that generate for C0511_c0000030 (box + oversize folder) on the staging site and C0187_c03265 (box + DO) on the production site. \r\n\r\nThanks for looking into this!
