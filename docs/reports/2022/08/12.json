          "body": "@Bess (@kelynch fyi ) I think we are going to need to talk further about how the metadata in Dublin Core will be translated to Datacite. There are cases where this may not move neatly. \r\n\r\nFor example, Neggin shared this record with me: [Supplement to PhD Dissertation: \"Subsurface Computational Modeling and Policy Analysis of Large-Scale Carbon Capture, Utilization, and Storage (2022)\"](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01n870zt98h)\r\n\r\n\"Referenced By\" in Neggin's example and \"Related Publication\" in Bess's example (if an ID is available for the publication) may both fall under the \"RelatedIdentifer\" property in Datacite, but may use different selections from the controlled lists in the subproperties. (See: [RelatedIdentifier in Datacite 4.4](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#12a-relatedidentifiertype)) As is, Bess's example might use \"Related Item\" for a better fit to Datacite. (See: [Related Item property in Datacite 4.4](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#20-relateditem)) \r\n\r\n**It will be important to check that both of these fields in Dublin Core/DataSpace have been used consistently, before assuming which of the aforementioned Datacite properties should be applied.**  \r\n\r\nAdditionally, we should discuss whether some Dublin Core properties have information that we don't want transferred to Datacite. These might contain information that isn't needed or desired in the new infrastructure. For example, I think Wind will have some thoughts on \"Collection\" for the main collection. However, these may be important to keep in place for PPPL. \r\n\r\nIn Bess's example, \"Description\" is capturing an auto-generated message about the README that might not be useful -- but that's something we need to discuss. I'm finding inconsistencies with how \"description\" is used. For [this example of chemistry data](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01z890rx36m) the description property was used to provide info about the software used. For [another chemistry data example](https://dataspace.princeton.edu/handle/88435/dsp01s1784p89m), the \"description\" property is used to describe a supplementary source. In both cases, this does not map from Dublin Core \"description\" property to DataCite \"description\" property. Different properties would be used for this info in Datacite.\r\n"
