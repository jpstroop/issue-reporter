Yes, it’s necessary to create Description.  It’s what displays in Alma.  The bulk import profile for items includes\r\n> NO IT DOESN’T\r\n> The import profile omits Description.  Not my fault!  Or maybe my fault for not checking everything.  I’ll put in a GitHub ticket to fix it.  I can’t fix it myself in production.  All they had to do was copy EVERYTHING I did in sandbox.\r\n> Anyway, blame-laying aside, yes.  If it’s a small number of items, just look them up and use the Generate button to fill in Description from Enumeration A.\r\n>  \r\n> Don\r\n>  \r\n> From: Phoebe E.

These are records that will not appear individually in the catalog, but exist because the boxes will be at ReCAP.\r\n> \r\n> Thank you,\r\n> Phoebe"
