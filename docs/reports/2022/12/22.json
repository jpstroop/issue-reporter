          "body": "I don't think there's a deep bug here, but the factory name should change: `:completed_work` is intended to be complete only in terms of data entry, but it has not been approved:\r\n```\r\n    factory :completed_work do\r\n      ...\r\n      state { \"awaiting_approval\" }\r\n```\r\nbut:\r\n```\r\n    def unfinished_works(user, search_terms = nil)\r\n      works_by_user_state(user, [\"none\", \"draft\", \"awaiting_approval\"], search_terms)\r\n    end\r\n```\r\n... and it'd definitely confusing for a \"complete\" work to be \"unfinished\". Adding `:approved_work` to the test instead does not cause any failures. The simple fix is to change the name of the factory to be less confusing."
