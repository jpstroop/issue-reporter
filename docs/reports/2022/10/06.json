          "body": "Aileen,\n\nMy recollection from a few months ago when the Award DOI was discussed at\none of the community calls is that they would like to see more labs adopt\nthe Award DOIs, but it was still in the early stages of awareness for many\nlabs.  I think many labs currently don't have the bandwidth and would\nrather see a few labs (PNNL for example) lead the way before making a\ndecision. At that time, it wasn't apparent to me how we would entirely use\nthe Award DOI service since I think PNNL is providing grants/sub-grants(?)\nfor users. Namely, they have a separate award number and thus tracking it\nvia an Award DOI makes sense.\n\nIf you think we should reach out to them now and explain our current\nscenario with our data repository, I can reach out.\n\nCheers,\n- Chun\n\nResearch Data Developer\nPrinceton Plasma Physics Laboratory\nPerformance Assurance & Contract Management\nORCID: 0000-0002-4245-2318 <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4245-2318>\n\n\n\nOn Thu, Oct 6, 2022 at 6:53 AM Aileen Pritch ***@***.***> wrote:\n\n> Chun, does OSTI have a position on this?\n>\n> Aileen Pritch\n> *Manager, Institutional Requirements & Research Products*\n> Performance Assurance and Contract Management\n> Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory\n> Office:  609-243-2245\n> Cell:  848-203-4005\n> ***@***.***\n>\n>\n>\n> On Thu, Oct 6, 2022 at 9:34 AM Chun Ly ***@***.***> wrote:\n>\n>> Hannah and Kate,\n>>\n>> Thanks for bringing this to my attention.
