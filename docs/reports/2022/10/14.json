(e.g. C1513 has P-000100; B-001168; L-000023)\n2. Why do the majority of collections have storage note \"Boxes 1-n\" (where n is the number of boxes in the collection), while the collections that would be affected by this ticket (e.g. C1513 and C1643) have storage notes with box names that are much longer and don't always start from 1?\n\nThanks for your time!"
