These are PPPL submissions, so let's check with Chun about how these would fit into Datacite.\r\n\r\n@astrochun, We are examining how to transcribe the funder information in these records to Datacite. We are currently assuming to use the following properties for [Funding Reference](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#19-fundingreference). (note: We will eventually have all of Datacite, but this is what we anticipate to start with.):\r\n- Funder Name\r\n- Award Number\r\n- Award URI\r\n\r\nDo you see the information in your currently published records fitting into these fields? Please let us know if you see a need (in the near future vs waiting a bit for the full Datacite schema to be properly added) for additional or different fields for the properties under Funding Reference. Thanks!"

I mostly end up where you are, but I also notice that the facets on the search results page are different. https://findingaids.princeton.edu/?utf8=%E2%9C%93&group=true&search_field=all_fields&q= I wonder if we should make a ticket to bring consistency between these two elements.\r\n\r\nI can definitely make the Table of Contents collapse symbol consistent with the facets on the search page, but in terms of changing the direction of the dropdown symbol on the facets I think that should be a separate ticket that we verify with @sdellis."
