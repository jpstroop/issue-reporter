We show that the helical centerline pitch and radius\r\n      of wild-type H. pylori cells dictate surface curvatures of considerably\r\n      higher positive and negative Gaussian curvatures than those present in\r\n      straight- or curved-rod bacteria. Quantitative 3D microscopy analysis of\r\n      short pulses with either N-acetylmuramic acid or D-alanine metabolic\r\n      probes showed that cell wall growth is enhanced at both sidewall curvature\r\n      extremes. Immunofluorescence revealed MreB is most abundant at negative\r\n      Gaussian curvature, while the bactofilin CcmA is most abundant at positive\r\n      Gaussian curvature. Strains expressing CcmA variants with altered\r\n      polymerization properties lose helical shape and associated positive\r\n      Gaussian curvatures. We thus propose a model where CcmA and MreB promote\r\n      PG synthesis at positive and negative Gaussian curvatures, respectively,\r\n      and that this patterning is one mechanism necessary for maintaining\r\n      helical shape. This dataset includes structured illumination fluorescence\r\n      microscopy images (SIM) and their associated cell shape reconstructions,\r\n      phase contrast micrographs, and transmission electron micrographs. See the\r\n      README.txt for detailed description of the strains and conditions\r\n      represented in each data file.\r\n    </description>\r\n  </descriptions>\r\n</resource>\r\n```"
