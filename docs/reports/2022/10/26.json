Steps to take in your local environment to test this. \r\n\r\n1. Structure -> Feeds Importers -> LibCal Events - Workshops -> Override\r\n2. First Check The \"Mappings\" settings under \"Processor\" and note the fields the feed is looking for. Confirm versions of these exist in the RSS feed.\r\n3. If the mapping is straightforward update the Parser to parse RSS\r\n4. Return to the Processor and re-map the fields. \r\n5. Go to /import/libcal_events_workshops and update the URL to use the RSS feed. \r\n6. Test the feed interactively from this page. I'm not entirely sure what will happen to content previously imported via the ICS feed. "
