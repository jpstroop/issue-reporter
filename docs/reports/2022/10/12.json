It's unclear what the issue is, but our best guess is that it has to do with the migration from Drupal 8 to Drupal 9, and the subsequent shift in configuration management, having to do with using the database versus yaml files.

Unfortunately, the Drupal 7 date_ical module relies on a very outdated version of the iCalcreator library, which is not compatible with PHP 8.\r\n\r\nFor context:\r\n\r\n- The [date_ical module documentation](https://git.drupalcode.org/project/date_ical/-/blob/7.x-3.x/README.txt) says: \"The author of iCalcreator made extenside backwards incompatible changes to the\r\nlibrary in the v2.22 release. Thus Date iCal does not support any version of\r\niCalcreator after v2.20.x.\"\r\n- PHP 8 support is not mentioned in the iCalcreator release notes until https://github.com/iCalcreator/iCalcreator/blob/master/releaseNotes#L132-L155\r\n\r\nThe results on PHP 8 are:\r\n\r\n- With iCalcreator 2.20.2 (the version currently in main), the libcal importer fails with an error about the curly brace array syntax (e.g. `$array{0}`)\r\n- With iCalcreator 2.20.4, the libcal importer hangs for several minutes, before giving a database timeout error"

Either we could hide the autocompleted text visually but not from screen readers, or we could effectively hide it but it also hid the search bar from screen readers.\r\n\r\nIt looks like there's a `hint` option on the typeahead initialization that is set to \"true\" in blacklight. It seems worth trying to override that initialization and set it to false instead.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/twitter/typeahead.js/blob/master/doc/jquery_typeahead.md\r\n\r\nI would try copying most of https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/blob/v7.29.0/app/javascript/blacklight/autocomplete.js into pulfalight_loader.es6 to see if we can initialize it with the hint off.\r\n\r\nAlso, an interesting note, blacklight has removed twitter typeahead for version 8: https://github.com/projectblacklight/blacklight/pull/2576"
