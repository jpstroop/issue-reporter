          "body": "Hannah and Kate,\n\nThanks for bringing this to my attention. I've CC-ed Aileen so she's aware.\nYou bring up an interesting point of how to disclose funding metadata. I\ncan show how DOE does this for those records in question. I believe\nDOE/OSTI has taken an easier approach of populating identifiers fields in\nthe DataCite metadata schema for funding instead of using any specific\nfunding field.\n\nHere are two DataSpace datasets with DOI minting from DOE:\n88435/dsp011g05ff77b:\nhttps://api.datacite.org/dois/application/vnd.datacite.datacite+json/10.11578/1888276\n88435/dsp013j3335393:\nhttps://api.datacite.org/dois/application/vnd.datacite.datacite+json/10.11578/1888262\n\nAs you can see, a separate identifiers field is provided with the grants\nnumbers.\n\nRegarding the original question, having additional metadata of who the\nfunder is and a URI to the grant is a good idea as Crossref and a number of\nopen infrastructures are moving in this direction with RORs and other\npersistent identifiers. However, I'm not sure how feasible this is for all\ngrants. While most PPPL funding is from DOE, there are separate\nsub-divisions (e.g., Office of Science), and there are also non-DOE funding\nsuch as NASA and NSF. Also, I'm not sure if our prime contract grant\n(DE-AC02-09CH11466) has a URI. I would not consider having full funding\nmetadata as MVP, but it could be something that we need in the future with\nthe push for NSPM-33 to use persistent identifiers (we had received\ninquiries from DOE on our current use of persistent identifiers - ORCID,\nROR, grants, etc.).\n\nAward DOIs have been discussed by the DOE community, but it's used\nsparingly at the moment. DOE has the following service that PPPL has not\nused: https://www.osti.gov/award-doi-service/. I know of only two labs that\nhave begun to experiment with this for their user facilities.\n\nCheers,\n- Chun\n\nResearch Data Developer\nPrinceton Plasma Physics Laboratory\nPerformance Assurance & Contract Management\nORCID: 0000-0002-4245-2318 <https://orcid.org/0000-0002-4245-2318>\n\n\n\nOn Wed, Oct 5, 2022 at 11:12 AM Hannah H ***@***.***> wrote:\n\n> Thanks @kelynch <https://github.com/kelynch>!

We will try to accommodate this request and will let you know if there are any barriers to doing so. \r\n\r\nThanks for providing the API examples. It looks like OSTI has probably used (11) AlternateIdentifier to record the DOE contract number. Although please correct me if I'm wrong. \r\n\r\nFor example: Using the [first example](https://api.datacite.org/dois/application/vnd.datacite.datacite+json/10.11578/1888276). The contract number is: AC02-09CH11466 and is highlighted in green in the image below. (note: I'm unable to show the whole record in the image.) Although the API is rendering the property as \"identifier,\" I suspect it's using [(11) Alternate Identifier](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#11-alternateidentifier) because that would follow the order of the properties. Additionally, the [(1) Identifier](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-mandatory-properties#1-identifier) property seems reserved for the DOI only.\r\n\r\n![Screen Shot 2022-10-11 at 9 50 11 AM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50670293/195110434-5c90b6c0-6905-4d42-ba68-0306ab5ebc84.jpeg)\r\n\r\nWe do intend to have the [(11) Alternate Identifier](https://support.datacite.org/docs/datacite-metadata-schema-v44-recommended-and-optional-properties#11-alternateidentifier) property available to record the ARK for each dataset, which will be absolutely necessary for the legacy records in DataSpace. This example may show that we need to allow more than one Alternate Identifier for PPPL. Please let me know if that sounds right to you.\r\n\r\n@kelynch and team, do you have additional thoughts on this as well?"
