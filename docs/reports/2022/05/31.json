That was a deliberate decision so that we could create our fixture objects on the server for demo and testing purposes. Do we know that webmock actually has a security issue? Or is this a general “don’t put things in production if you don’t actually need them there” concern? I’m really glad to talk about different choices we might make, but I’d like to suggest that the ability to easily create our fixture objects on the server is a valuable feature, especially during development. Might we compromise and say we’ll remove it from the main group when we make the site available outside VPN?"
